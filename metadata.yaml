description: In this 1907 novel, a young English lord retires to Scarsmoor Castle
  to write his autobiography. There he encounters Helena, a beautiful neighbor who
  blocks his access to the beach by closing off a private pathway. As tensions rise
  between the neighbors, so, too, does a passion that surprises them both.
