<h3>AMBROSE, LORD LYNBOROUGH</h3>


<p>Common opinion said that Lord Lynborough
ought never to have had a peerage and
forty thousand a year; he ought to have had
a pound a week and a back bedroom in
Bloomsbury. Then he would have become an
eminent man; as it was, he turned out only
a singularly erratic individual.</p>

<p>So much for common opinion. Let no
more be heard of its dull utilitarian judgements!
There are plenty of eminent men&mdash;at
the moment, it is believed, no less than
seventy Cabinet and ex-Cabinet Ministers
(or thereabouts)&mdash;to say nothing of Bishops,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Judges, and the British Academy,&mdash;and
all this in a nook of the world! (And the
world too is a point!) Lynborough was
something much more uncommon; it is
not, however, quite easy to say what. Let
the question be postponed; perhaps the
story itself will answer it.</p>

<p>He started life&mdash;or was started in it&mdash;in
a series of surroundings of unimpeachable
orthodoxy&mdash;Eton, Christ Church, the Grenadier
Guards. He left each of these schools
of mental culture and bodily discipline, not
under a cloud&mdash;that metaphor would be
ludicrously inept&mdash;but in an explosion.
That, having been thus shot out of the first,
he managed to enter the second&mdash;that,
having been shot out of the second, he
walked placidly into the third&mdash;that, having
been shot out of the third, he suffered no
apparent damage from his repeated propulsions&mdash;these
are matters explicable only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
by a secret knowledge of British institutions.
His father was strong, his mother came of
stock even stronger; he himself&mdash;Ambrose
Caverly as he then was&mdash;was very popular,
and extraordinarily handsome in his unusual
outlandish style.</p>

<p>His father being still alive&mdash;and, though
devoted to him, by now apprehensive of
his doings&mdash;his means were for the next
few years limited. Yet he contrived to employ
himself. He took a soup-kitchen and
ran it; he took a yacht and sank it; he took a
public-house, ruined it, and got himself
severely fined for watering the beer in the
Temperance interest. This injustice rankled
in him deeply, and seems to have permanently
influenced his development. For a
time he forsook the world and joined a sect
of persons who called themselves "Theo-philanthropists"&mdash;and
surely no man could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
call himself much more than that? Returning
to mundane affairs, he refused to pay
his rates, stood for Parliament in the Socialist
interest, and, being defeated, declared himself
a practical follower of Count Tolstoi.
His father advising a short holiday, he
went off and narrowly escaped being shot
somewhere in the Balkans, owing to his
having taken too keen an interest in local
politics. (He ought to have been shot; he
was clear&mdash;and even vehement&mdash;on that
point in a letter which he wrote to <i>The
Times</i>.) Then he sent for Leonard Stabb,
disappeared in company with that gentleman,
and was no more seen for some years.</p>

<p>He could always send for Stabb, so faithful
was that learned student's affection for
him. A few years Ambrose Caverly's senior,
Stabb had emerged late and painfully from a
humble origin and a local grammar school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
had gone up to Oxford as a non-collegiate
man, had gained a first-class and a fellowship,
and had settled down to a life of research.
Early in his career he became known
by the sobriquet of "Cromlech Stabb"&mdash;even
his unlearned friends would call him
"Cromlech" oftener than by any other
name. His elaborate monograph on cromlechs
had earned him the title; subsequently
he extended his researches to other relics of
ancient religions&mdash;or ancient forms of
religion, as he always preferred to put it;
"there being," he would add, with the simplicity
of erudition beaming through his
spectacles on any auditor, orthodox or other,
"of course, only one religion." He was a very
large stout man; his spectacles were large
too. He was very strong, but by no means
mobile. Ambrose's father regarded Stabb's
companionship as a certain safeguard to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
heir. The validity of this idea is doubtful.
Students have so much curiosity&mdash;and so
many diverse scenes and various types of
humanity can minister to that appetite of the
mind.</p>

<p>Occasional rumors about Ambrose Caverly
reached his native shores; he was heard
of in Morocco, located in Spain, familiar
in North and in South America. Once he
was not heard of for a year; his father and
friends concluded that he must be dead&mdash;or
in prison. Happily the latter explanation
proved correct. Once more he and the law
had come to loggerheads; when he emerged
from confinement he swore never to employ
on his own account an instrument so hateful.</p>

<p>"A gentleman should fight his own battles,
Cromlech," he cried to his friend. "I did no
more than put a bullet in his arm&mdash;in a
fair encounter&mdash;and he let me go to prison!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monstrous!" Stabb agreed with a smile.
He had passed the year in a dirty little inn
by the prison gate&mdash;among scoundrels, but
fortunately in the vicinity of some mounds
distinctly prehistoric.</p>

<p>Old Lord Lynborough's death occurred
suddenly and unexpectedly, at a moment
when Ambrose and his companion could not
be found. They were somewhere in Peru&mdash;Stabb
among the Incas, Ambrose probably
in less ancient company. It was six months
before the news reached them.</p>

<p>"I must go home and take up my responsibilities,
Cromlech," said the new
Lord Lynborough.</p>

<p>"You really think you'd better?" queried
Stabb doubtfully.</p>

<p>"It was my father's wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, well&mdash;! But you'll be thought odd
over there, Ambrose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Odd? I odd? What the deuce is there
odd about me, Cromlech?"</p>

<p>"Everything." The investigator stuck his
cheroot back in his mouth.</p>

<p>Lynborough considered dispassionately&mdash;as
he fain would hope. "I don't see
it."</p>

<p>That was the difficulty. Stabb was well
aware of it. A man who is odd, and knows it,
may be proud, but he will be careful; he
may swagger, but he will take precautions.
Lynborough had no idea that he was odd;
he followed his nature&mdash;in all its impulses
and in all its whims&mdash;with equal fidelity
and simplicity. This is not to say that he was
never amused at himself; every intelligent
observer is amused at himself pretty often;
but he did not doubt merely because he was
amused. He took his entertainment over his
own doings as a bonus life offered. A great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
sincerity of action and of feeling was his
predominant characteristic.</p>

<p>"Besides, if I'm odd," he went on with a
laugh, "it won't be noticed. I'm going to
bury myself at Scarsmoor for a couple of
years at least. I'm thinking of writing an
autobiography. You'll come with me, Cromlech?"</p>

<p>"I must be totally undisturbed," Stabb
stipulated. "I've a great deal of material to
get into shape."</p>

<p>"There'll be nobody there but myself&mdash;and
a secretary, I daresay."</p>

<p>"A secretary? What's that for?"</p>

<p>"To write the book, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," said Stabb, smiling in a slow
fat fashion. "You won't write your autobiography
yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not unless I find it very engrossing."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come," said Stabb.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>So home they came&mdash;an unusual-looking
pair&mdash;Stabb with his towering bulky frame,
his big goggles, his huge head with its scanty
black locks encircling a face like a harvest
moon&mdash;Lynborough, tall, too, but lean
as a lath, with tiny feet and hands, a rare
elegance of carriage, a crown of chestnut hair,
a long straight nose, a waving mustache, a
chin pointed like a needle and scarcely
thickened to the eye by the close-cropped,
short, pointed beard he wore. His bright
hazel eyes gleamed out from his face with an
attractive restlessness that caught away a
stranger's first attention even from the rare
beauty of the lines of his head and face; it
was regularity over-refined, sharpened almost
to an outline of itself. But his appearance
tempted him to no excesses of costume;
he had always despised that facile path to a
barren eccentricity. On every occasion he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
wore what all men of breeding were wearing,
yet invested the prescribed costume with the
individuality of his character: this, it seems,
is as near as the secret of dressing well can
be tracked.</p>

<p>His manner was not always deemed so
free from affectation; it was, perhaps, a
little more self-conscious; it was touched
with a foreign courtliness, and he employed,
on occasions of any ceremony or in intercourse
with ladies, a certain formality of
speech; it was said of him by an observant
woman that he seemed to be thinking in a
language more ornate and picturesque than
his tongue employed. He was content to say
the apt thing, not striving after wit; he was
more prone to hide a joke than to tell it;
he would ignore a victory and laugh at a
defeat; yet he followed up the one and never
sat down under the other, unless it were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>flicted
by one he loved. He liked to puzzle,
but took no conscious pains to amuse.</p>

<p>Thus he returned to his "responsibilities."
Cromlech Stabb was wondering what that
dignified word would prove to describe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<h3>LARGELY TOPOGRAPHICAL</h3>


<p>Miss Gilletson had been studying the local
paper, which appeared every Saturday and
reached Nab Grange on the following morning.
She uttered an exclamation, looked up
from her small breakfast-table, and called
over to the Marchesa's small breakfast-table.</p>

<p>"Helena, I see that Lord Lynborough
arrived at the Castle on Friday!"</p>

<p>"Did he, Jennie?" returned the Marchesa,
with no show of interest. "Have an
egg, Colonel?" The latter words were addressed
to her companion at table, Colonel
Wenman, a handsome but bald-headed man
of about forty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Lord Lynborough, accompanied by
his friend Mr. Leonard Stabb, the well-known
authority on prehistoric remains,
and Mr. Roger Wilbraham, his private
secretary. His lordship's household had
preceded him to the Castle.'"</p>

<p>Lady Norah Mountliffey&mdash;who sat with
Miss Gilletson&mdash;was in the habit of saying
what she thought. What she said now was:
"Thank goodness!" and she said it rather
loudly.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen haven't been amusing
Norah," observed the Marchesa to the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"I hoped that I, at least, was engaged on
another task&mdash;though, alas, a harder one!"
he answered in a low tone and with a glance
of respectful homage.</p>

<p>"If you refer to me, you've been admirably
successful," the Marchesa assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
him graciously&mdash;only with the graciousness
there mingled that touch of mockery which
always made the Colonel rather ill at ease.
"Amuse" is, moreover, a word rich in shades
of meaning.</p>

<p>Miss Gilletson was frowning thoughtfully.
"Helena can't call on him&mdash;and I don't
suppose he'll call on her," she said to
Norah.</p>

<p>"He'll get to know her if he wants to."</p>

<p>"I might call on him," suggested the
Colonel. "He was in the service, you know,
and that&mdash;er&mdash;makes a bond. Queer
fellow he was, by Jove!"</p>

<p>Captain Irons and Mr. Stillford came in
from riding, late for breakfast. They completed
the party at table, for Violet Dufaure
always took the first meal of the day in
bed. Irons was a fine young man, still in the
twenties, very fair and very bronzed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
had seen fighting and was great at polo.
Stillford, though a man of peace (if a
solicitor may so be called), was by no means
inferior in physique. A cadet of a good
county family, he was noted in the hunting
field and as a long-distance swimmer. He
had come to Nab Grange to confer with the
Marchesa on her affairs, but, proving himself
an acquisition to the party, had been
pressed to stay on as a guest.</p>

<p>The men began to bandy stories of Lynborough
from one table to the other. Wenman
knew the London gossip, Stillford the
local traditions: but neither had seen the
hero of their tales for many years. The anecdotes
delighted Norah Mountliffey, and
caused Miss Gilletson's hands to fly up in
horror. Nevertheless it was Miss Gilletson
who said, "Perhaps we shall see him at
church to-day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not likely!" Stillford opined. "And&mdash;er&mdash;is
anybody going?"</p>

<p>The pause which habitually follows this
question ensued upon it now. Neither the
Marchesa nor Lady Norah would go&mdash;they
were both of the Old Church. Miss Dufaure
was unlikely to go, by reason of fatigue.
Miss Gilletson would, of course, go, so
would Colonel Wenman&mdash;but that was so
well known that they didn't speak.</p>

<p>"Any ladies with Lynborough's party, I
wonder!" Captain Irons hazarded. "I think
I'll go! Stillford, you ought to go to church&mdash;family
solicitor and all that, eh?"</p>

<p>A message suddenly arrived from Miss
Dufaure, to say that she felt better and
proposed to attend church&mdash;could she be
sent?</p>

<p>"The carriage is going anyhow," said
Miss Gilletson a trifle stiffly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose I ought," Stillford agreed.
"We'll drive there and walk back?"</p>

<p>"Right you are!" said the Captain.</p>

<p>By following the party from Nab Grange
to Fillby parish church, a partial idea of the
locality would be gained; but perhaps it is
better to face the complete task at once.
Idle tales suit idle readers; a history such as
this may legitimately demand from those
who study it some degree of mental application.</p>

<p>If, then, the traveler lands from the North
Sea (which is the only sea he can land from)
he will find himself on a sandy beach,
dipping rapidly to deep water and well
adapted for bathing. As he stands facing inland,
the sands stretch in a long line southerly
on his left; on his right rises the bold
bluff of Sandy Nab with its swelling outline,
its grass-covered dunes, and its sparse firs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
directly in front of him, abutting on the
beach, is the high wall inclosing the Grange
property; a gate in the middle gives access
to the grounds. The Grange faces south, and
lies in the shelter of Sandy Nab. In front of
it are pleasure-grounds, then a sunk fence,
then spacious meadow-lands. The property
is about a mile and a half (rather more
than less) in length, to half-a-mile in breadth.
Besides the Grange there is a small farmhouse,
or bailiff's house, in the southwest
corner of the estate. On the north the
boundary consists of moorlands, to the east
(as has been seen) of the beach, to the west
and south of a public road. At the end of the
Grange walls this road turns to the right,
inland, and passes by Fillby village; it then
develops into the highroad to Easthorpe
with its market, shops, and station, ten miles
away. Instead, however, of pursuing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
longer route, the traveler from the Grange
grounds may reach Fillby and Easthorpe
sooner by crossing the road on the west, and
traversing the Scarsmoor Castle property,
across which runs a broad carriage road,
open to the public. He will first&mdash;after
entering Lord Lynborough's gates&mdash;pass
over a bridge which spans a little river, often
nearly dry, but liable to be suddenly flooded
by a rainfall in the hills. Thus he enters a
beautiful demesne, rich in wood and undergrowth,
in hill and valley, in pleasant rides
and winding drives. The Castle itself&mdash;an
ancient gray building, square and massive,
stands on an eminence in the northwest
extremity of the property; the ground drops
rapidly in front of it, and it commands a
view of Nab Grange and the sea beyond,
being in its turn easily visible from either of
these points. The road above mentioned, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
leaving Lynborough's park, runs across the
moors in a southwesterly line to Fillby, a
little village of some three hundred souls.
All around and behind this, stretching to
Easthorpe, are great rolling moors, rich in
beauty as in opportunities for sport, yet
cutting off the little settlement of village,
Castle, and Grange from the outer world
by an isolation more complete than the mere
distance would in these days seem to entail.
The church, two or three little shops, and
one policeman, sum up Fillby's resources:
anything more, for soul's comfort, for body's
supply or protection, must come across the
moors from Easthorpe.</p>

<p>One point remains&mdash;reserved to the end
by reason of its importance. A gate has been
mentioned as opening on to the beach from
the grounds of Nab Grange. He who enters
at that gate and makes for the Grange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
follows the path for about two hundred
yards in a straight line, and then takes a
curving turn to the right, which in time
brings him to the front door of the house.
But the path goes on&mdash;growing indeed narrower,
ultimately becoming a mere grass-grown
track, yet persisting quite plain to
see&mdash;straight across the meadows, about
a hundred yards beyond the sunk fence
which bounds the Grange gardens, and in
full view from the Grange windows; and it
desists not from its course till it reaches the
rough stone wall which divides the Grange
estate from the highroad on the west. This
wall it reaches at a point directly opposite
to the Scarsmoor lodge; in the wall there
is a gate, through which the traveler must
pass to gain the road.</p>

<p>There is a gate&mdash;and there had always
been a gate; that much at least is undisputed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
It will, of course, be obvious that if the residents
at the Castle desired to reach the beach
for the purpose of bathing or other diversions,
and proposed to go on their feet,
incomparably their best, shortest, and most
convenient access thereto lay through this
gate and along the path which crossed the
Grange property and issued through the
Grange gate on to the seashore. To go round
by the road would take at least three times
as long. Now the season was the month of
June; Lord Lynborough was a man tenacious
of his rights&mdash;and uncommonly fond of
bathing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it might well be that
the Marchesa di San Servolo&mdash;the present
owner of Nab Grange&mdash;would prefer that
strangers should not pass across her property,
in full view and hail of her windows, without
her permission and consent. That this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
indeed, was the lady's attitude might be
gathered from the fact that, on this Sunday
morning in June, Captain Irons and Mr.
Stillford, walking back through the Scarsmoor
grounds from Fillby church as they
had proposed, found the gate leading from
the road into the Grange meadows securely
padlocked. Having ignored this possibility,
they had to climb, incidentally displacing,
but carefully replacing, a number of prickly
furze branches which the zeal of the Marchesa's
bailiff had arranged along the top
rail of the gate.</p>

<p>"Boys been coming in?" asked Irons.</p>

<p>"It may be that," said Stillford, smiling
as he arranged the prickly defenses to the
best advantage.</p>

<p>The Grange expedition to church had to
confess to having seen nothing of the Castle
party&mdash;and in so far it was dubbed a failure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
There was indeed a decorous row of servants
in the household seat, but the square oaken
pew in the chancel, with its brass rods and
red curtains in front, and its fireplace at the
back, stood empty. The two men reported
having met, as they walked home through
Scarsmoor, a very large fat man with a face
which they described variously, one likening
it to the sinking sun on a misty day, the other
to a copper saucepan.</p>

<p>"Not Lord Lynborough, I do trust!"
shuddered little Violet Dufaure. She and
Miss Gilletson had driven home by the road,
regaining the Grange by the south gate and
the main drive.</p>

<p>Stillford was by the Marchesa. He spoke
to her softly, covered by the general conversation.
"You might have told us to take a
key!" he said reproachfully. "That gorse
is very dangerous to a man's Sunday clothes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"It looks&mdash;businesslike, doesn't it?" she
smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, uncommon! When did you have it
done?"</p>

<p>"The day before yesterday. I wanted
there to be no mistake from the very first.
That's the best way to prevent any unpleasantness."</p>

<p>"Possibly." Stillford sounded doubtful.
"Going to have a notice-board, Marchesa?"</p>

<p>"He will hardly make that necessary,
will he?"</p>

<p>"Well, I told you that in my judgment
your right to shut it against him is very
doubtful."</p>

<p>"You told me a lot of things I didn't
understand," she retorted rather pettishly.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders with a laugh.
No good lay in anticipating trouble. Lord
Lynborough might take no notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon the Marchesa's guests
played golf on a rather makeshift nine-hole
course laid out in the meadows. Miss Gilletson
slept. The Marchesa herself mounted
the top of Sandy Nab, and reviewed her
situation. The Colonel would doubtless have
liked to accompany her, but he was not
thereto invited.</p>

<p>Helena Vittoria Maria Antonia, Marchesa
di San Servolo, was now in her twenty-fourth
year. Born of an Italian father and an
English mother, she had bestowed her hand
on her paternal country, but her heart remained
in her mother's. The Marchese
took her as his second wife and his last
pecuniary resource; in both capacities she
soothed his declining years. Happily for her&mdash;and
not unhappily for the world at large&mdash;these
were few. He had not time to absorb
her youth or to spend more than a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
portion of her inheritance. She was left
a widow&mdash;stepmother of adult Italian
offspring&mdash;owner for life of an Apennine
fortress. She liked the fortress much, but
disliked the stepchildren (the youngest was of
her own age) more. England&mdash;her mother's
home&mdash;presented itself in the light of a
refuge. In short, she had grave doubts about
ever returning to Italy.</p>

<p>Nab Grange was in the market. Ancestrally
a possession of the Caverlys (for centuries
a noble but unennobled family in
those parts), it had served for the family's
dower-house, till a bad race-meeting had induced
the squire of the day to sell it to a Mr.
Cross of Leeds. The Crosses held it for
seventy years. Then the executors of the last
Cross sold it to the Marchesa. This final
transaction happened a year before Lynborough
came home. The "Beach Path"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
had, as above recorded, been closed only for
two days.</p>

<p>The path was not just now in the Marchesa's
thoughts. Nothing very definite was.
Rather, as her eyes ranged from moor to
sea, from the splendid uniformity of the unclouded
sky to the ravishing variety of many-tinted
earth, from the green of the Grange
meadows (the one spot of rich emerald on
the near coast-line, owing its hues to Sandy
Nab's kindly shelter) to the gray mass of
Scarsmoor Castle&mdash;there was in her heart
that great mixture of content and longing
that youth and&mdash;(what put bluntly amounts
to)&mdash;a fine day are apt to raise. And youth
allied with beauty becomes self-assertive,
a claimant against the world, a plaintiff
against facts before High Heaven's tribunal.
The Marchesa was infinitely delighted with
Nab Grange&mdash;graciously content with Na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ture&mdash;not
ill-pleased with herself&mdash;but,
in fine, somewhat discontented with her
company. That was herself? Not precisely,
though, at the moment, objectively. She
was wondering whether her house-party
was all that her youth and her beauty&mdash;to
say nothing of her past endurance of the
Marchese&mdash;entitled her to claim and to
enjoy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly across her vision, cutting
the sky-line, seeming to divide for a moment
heaven above from earth beneath, passed
a tall meager figure, and a head of lines clean
as if etched by a master's needle. The profile
stood as carved in fine ivory; glints of color
flashed from hair and beard. The man softly
sang a love song as he walked&mdash;but he
never looked toward the Marchesa.</p>

<p>She sat up suddenly. "Could that be Lord
Lynborough?" she thought&mdash;and smiled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h3>OF LAW AND NATURAL RIGHTS</h3>


<p>Lynborough sat on the terrace which ran
along the front of the Castle and looked
down, over Nab Grange, to the sea. With
him were Leonard Stabb and Roger Wilbraham.
The latter was a rather short,
slight man of dark complexion; although a
light-weight he was very wiry and a fine
boxer. His intellectual gifts corresponded
well with his physical equipment; an acute
ready mind was apt to deal with every-day
problems and pressing necessities; it had
little turn either for speculation or for fancy.
He had dreams neither about the past,
like Stabb, nor about present things, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Lynborough. His was, in a word, the practical
spirit, and Lynborough could not have
chosen a better right-hand man.</p>

<p>They were all smoking; a silence had
rested long over the party. At last Lynborough
spoke.</p>

<p>"There's always," he said, "something
seductive in looking at a house when you
know nothing about the people who live in it."</p>

<p>"But I know a good deal about them,"
Wilbraham interposed with a laugh. "Coltson's
been pumping all the village, and I've
had the benefit of it." Coltson was Lynborough's
own man, an old soldier who
had been with him nearly fifteen years and
had accompanied him on all his travels
and excursions.</p>

<p>Lynborough paid no heed; he was not the
man to be put off his reflections by intrusive
facts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"The blank wall of a strange house is
like the old green curtain at the theater. It
may rise for you any moment and show
you&mdash;what? Now what is there at Nab
Grange?"</p>

<p>"A lot of country bumpkins, I expect,"
growled Stabb.</p>

<p>"No, no," Wilbraham protested. "I'll
tell you, if you like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's there?" Lynborough pursued.
"I don't know. You don't know&mdash;no, you
don't, Roger, and you probably wouldn't
even if you were inside. But I like not knowing&mdash;I
don't want to know. We won't
visit at the Grange, I think. We will just
idealize it, Cromlech." He cast his queer
elusive smile at his friend.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" said Stabb. "There's sure to be
a woman there&mdash;and I'll be bound she'll
call on you!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"She'll call on me? Why?"</p>

<p>"Because you're a lord," said Stabb,
scorning any more personal form of flattery.</p>

<p>"That fortuitous circumstance should, in
my judgment, rather afford me protection."</p>

<p>"If you come to that, she's somebody herself."
Wilbraham's knowledge would bubble
out, for all the want of encouragement.</p>

<p>"Everybody's somebody," murmured
Lynborough&mdash;"and it is a very odd arrangement.
Can't be regarded as permanent,
eh, Cromlech? Immortality by merit seems
a better idea. And by merit I mean originality.
Well&mdash;I sha'n't know the Grange, but I like
to look at it. The way I picture her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Picture whom?" asked Stabb.</p>

<p>"Why, the Lady of the Grange, to be
sure&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, who's thinking of the woman?&mdash;if
there is a woman at all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am thinking of the woman, Cromlech,
and I've a perfect right to think of her. At
least, if not of that woman, of a woman&mdash;whose
like I've never met."</p>

<p>"She must be of an unusual type," opined
Stabb with a reflective smile.</p>

<p>"She is, Cromlech. Shall I describe her?"</p>

<p>"I expect you must."</p>

<p>"Yes, at this moment&mdash;with the evening
just this color&mdash;and the Grange down
there&mdash;and the sea, Cromlech, so remarkably
large, I'm afraid I must. She is, of
course, tall and slender; she has, of course, a
rippling laugh; her eyes are, of course,
deep and dreamy, yet lighting to a sparkle
when one challenges. All this may be presupposed.
It's her tint, Cromlech, her color&mdash;that's
what's in my mind to-night; that,
you will find, is her most distinguishing,
her most wonderful characteristic."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just what the Vicar told Coltson!
At least he said that the Marchesa had a
most extraordinary complexion." Wilbraham
had got something out at last.</p>

<p>"Roger, you bring me back to earth. You
substitute the Vicar's impression for my
imagination. Is that kind?"</p>

<p>"It seems such a funny coincidence."</p>

<p>"Supposing it to be a mere coincidence&mdash;no
doubt! But I've always known that I had
to meet that complexion somewhere. If here&mdash;so
much the better!"</p>

<p>"I have a great doubt about that," said
Leonard Stabb.</p>

<p>"I can get over it, Cromlech! At least
consider that."</p>

<p>"But you're not going to know her!"
laughed Wilbraham.</p>

<p>"I shall probably see her as we walk
down to bathe by Beach Path."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>A deferential voice spoke from behind
his chair. "I beg your pardon, my lord, but
Beach Path is closed." Coltson had brought
Lynborough his cigar-case and laid it down
on a table by him as he communicated this
intelligence.</p>

<p>"Closed, Coltson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. There's a padlock on the
gate, and a&mdash;er&mdash;barricade of furze. And
the gardeners tell me they were warned off
yesterday."</p>

<p>"My gardeners warned off Beach
Path?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"By whose orders?"</p>

<p>"Her Excellency's, my lord."</p>

<p>"That's the Marchesa&mdash;Marchesa di
San Servolo," Wilbraham supplied.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the name, sir," said Coltson
respectfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about her complexion now, Ambrose?"
chuckled Stabb.</p>

<p>"The Marchesa di San Servolo? Is that
right, Coltson?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly correct, my lord. Italian, I
understand, my lord."</p>

<p>"Excellent, excellent! She has closed my
Beach Path? I think I have reflected enough
for to-night. I'll go in and write a letter."
He rose, smiled upon Stabb, who himself
was grinning broadly, and walked through
an open window into the house.</p>

<p>"Now you may see something happen,"
said Leonard Stabb.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? Is it a public path?"
asked Wilbraham.</p>

<p>With a shrug Stabb denied all knowledge&mdash;and,
probably, all interest. Coltson,
who had lingered behind his master, undertook
to reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not exactly public, as I understand, sir.
But the Castle has always used it. Green&mdash;that's
the head-gardener&mdash;tells me so, at
least."</p>

<p>"By legal right, do you mean?" Wilbraham
had been called to the Bar, although he
had never practised. No situation gives rise
to greater confidence on legal problems.</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll find that his lordship
will trouble much about that, sir," was
Coltson's answer, as he picked up the cigar-case
again and hurried into the library with
it.</p>

<p>"What does the man mean by that?"
asked Wilbraham scornfully. "It's a purely
legal question&mdash;Lynborough must trouble
about it." He rose and addressed Stabb
somewhat as though that gentleman were
the Court. "Not a public right of way?
We don't argue that? Then it's a case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
dominant and servient tenement&mdash;a right
of way by user as of right, or by a lost grant.
That&mdash;or nothing!"</p>

<p>"I daresay," muttered Stabb very absently.</p>

<p>"Then what does Coltson mean&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Coltson knows Ambrose&mdash;you don't.
Ambrose will never go to law&mdash;but he'll
go to bathe."</p>

<p>"But she'll go to law if he goes to bathe!"
cried the lawyer.</p>

<p>Stabb blinked lazily, and seemed to loom
enormous over his cigar. "I daresay&mdash;if
she's got a good case," said he. "Do you
know, Wilbraham, I don't much care
whether she does or not? But in regard to
her complexion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the devil does her complexion
matter?" shouted Wilbraham.</p>

<p>"The human side of a thing always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
matters," observed Leonard Stabb. "For
instance&mdash;pray sit down, Wilbraham&mdash;standing
up and talking loud prove nothing,
if people would only believe it&mdash;the permanence
of hierarchical systems may be
historically observed to bear a direct relation
to the emoluments."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me your opinion
on two points, Stabb? We can go on with
that argument of yours afterward."</p>

<p>"Say on, Wilbraham."</p>

<p>"Is Lynborough in his right senses?"</p>

<p>"The point is doubtful."</p>

<p>"Are you in yours?"</p>

<p>Stabb reflected. "I am sane&mdash;but very
highly specialized," was his conclusion.</p>

<p>Wilbraham wrinkled his brow. "All the
same, right of way or no right of way is
purely a legal question," he persisted.</p>

<p>"I think you're highly specialized too,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
said Stabb. "But you'd better keep quiet and
see it through, you know. There may be
some fun&mdash;it will serve to amuse the Archdeacon
when you write." Wilbraham's
father was a highly esteemed dignitary of
the order mentioned.</p>

<p>Lynborough came out again, smoking a
cigar. His manner was noticeably more
alert: his brow was unclouded, his whole
mien tranquil and placid.</p>

<p>"I've put it all right," he observed. "I've
written her a civil letter. Will you men bathe
to-morrow?"</p>

<p>They both assented to the proposition.</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll start at eight. We may
as well walk. By Beach Path it's only about
half-a-mile."</p>

<p>"But the path's stopped, Ambrose,"
Stabb objected.</p>

<p>"I've asked her to have the obstruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
removed before eight o'clock," Lynborough
explained.</p>

<p>"If it isn't?" asked Roger Wilbraham.</p>

<p>"We have hands," answered Lynborough,
looking at his own very small ones.</p>

<p>"Wilbraham wants to know why you
don't go to law, Ambrose."</p>

<p>Lord Lynborough never shrank from explaining
his views and convictions.</p>

<p>"The law disgusts me. So does my experience
of it. You remember the beer,
Cromlech? Nobody ever acted more wisely
or from better motives. And if I made money&mdash;as
I did, till the customers left off coming&mdash;why
not? I was unobtrusively doing good.
Then Juanita's affair! I acted as a gentleman
is bound to act. Result&mdash;a year's
imprisonment! I lay stress on these personal
experiences, but not too great stress. The
law, Roger, always considers what you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
had and what you now have&mdash;never what
you ought to have. Take that path! It
happens to be a fact that my grandfather,
and my father, and I have always used that
path. That's important by law, I daresay&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"Just what would be important by law!"
commented Lynborough. "And I have
made use of the fact in my letter to the
Marchesa. But in my own mind I stand on
reason and natural right. Is it reasonable
that I, living half-a-mile from my bathing,
should have to walk two miles to get to it?
Plainly not. Isn't it the natural right of the
owner of Scarsmoor to have that path open
through Nab Grange? Plainly yes. That,
Roger, although, as I say, not the shape in
which I have put the matter before the Marchesa&mdash;because
she, being a woman, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
be unappreciative of pure reason&mdash;is really
the way in which the question presents itself
to my mind&mdash;and, I'm sure, to Cromlech's?"</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world to mine," said
Stabb. "However, Ambrose, the young man
thinks us both mad."</p>

<p>"You do, Roger?" His smile persuaded
to an affirmative reply.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"No 'Lord,' if you love me! Why do you
think me mad? Cromlech, of course, is mad,
so we needn't bother about him."</p>

<p>"You're not&mdash;not practical," stammered
Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, really I don't know.
You'll see that I shall get that path open.
And in the end I did get that public-house
closed. And Juanita's husband had to leave
the country, owing to the heat of local feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&mdash;aroused
entirely by me. Juanita stayed
behind and, after due formalities, married
again most happily. I'm not altogether inclined
to call myself unpractical. Roger!"
He turned quickly to his secretary. "Your
father's what they call a High Churchman,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and so am I," said Roger.</p>

<p>"He has his Church. He puts that above
the State, doesn't he? He wouldn't obey the
State against the Church? He wouldn't
do what the Church said was wrong because
the State said it was right?"</p>

<p>"How could he? Of course he wouldn't,"
answered Roger.</p>

<p>"Well, I have my Church&mdash;inside here."
He touched his breast. "I stand where your
father does. Why am I more mad than the
Archdeacon, Roger?"</p>

<p>"But there's all the difference!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course there is," said Stabb. "All the
difference that there is between being able
to do it and not being able to do it&mdash;and I
know of none so profound."</p>

<p>"There's no difference at all," declared
Lynborough. "Therefore&mdash;as a good son,
no less than as a good friend&mdash;you will
come and bathe with me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll come and bathe, by all means,
Lynborough."</p>

<p>"By all means! Well said, young man. By
all means, that is, which are becoming in
opposing a lady. What precisely those may
be we will consider when we see the strength
of her opposition."</p>

<p>"That doesn't sound so very unpractical,
after all," Stabb suggested to Roger.</p>

<p>Lynborough took his stand before Stabb,
hands in pockets, smiling down at the bulk
of his friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"O Cromlech, Haunter of Tombs," he
said, "Cromlech, Lover of Men long Dead,
there is a possible&mdash;indeed a probable&mdash;chance&mdash;there
is a divine hope&mdash;that Life
may breathe here on this coast, that the
blood may run quick, that the world may
move, that our old friend Fortune may
smile, and trick, and juggle, and favor us
once more. This, Cromlech, to a man who
had determined to reform, who came home
to assume&mdash;what was it? Oh yes&mdash;responsibilities!&mdash;this
is most extraordinary
luck. Never shall it be said that Ambrose
Caverly, being harnessed and carrying a
bow, turned himself back in the day of
battle!"</p>

<p>He swayed himself to and fro on his heels,

decorously by the highroad and the

will she read it with a beating heart? Will
she read it with a flushing cheek? And if so,
Cromlech, what, I ask you, will be the
particular shade of that particular flush?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the sweetness of the game!" said he.</p>

<h3>THE MESSAGE OF A PADLOCK</h3>


<blockquote><p>Lord Lynborough presents his compliments to her Excellency
the Marchesa di San Servolo. Lord Lynborough
has learnt, with surprise and regret, that his servants have
within the last two days been warned off Beach Path, and
that a padlock and other obstacles have been placed on
the gate leading to the path, by her Excellency's orders.
Lord Lynborough and his predecessors have enjoyed the
use of this path by themselves, their agents and servants,
for many years back&mdash;certainly for fifty, as Lord Lynborough
knows from his father and from old servants, and
Lord Lynborough is not disposed to acquiesce in any
obstruction being raised to his continued use of it. He
must therefore request her Excellency to have the kindness
to order that the padlock and other obstacles shall be
removed, and he will be obliged by this being done before
eight o'clock to-morrow morning&mdash;at which time Lord
Lynborough intends to proceed by Beach Path to the sea
in order to bathe. Scarsmoor Castle; 13th June.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reception of this letter proved an agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>able
incident of an otherwise rather dull
Sunday evening at Nab Grange. The Marchesa
had been bored; the Colonel was
sulky. Miss Gilletson had forbidden cards;
her conscience would not allow herself, nor
her feelings of envy permit other people,
to play on the Sabbath. Lady Norah and
Violet Dufaure were somewhat at cross-purposes,
each preferring to talk to Stillford
and endeavoring, under a false show
of amity, to foist Captain Irons on to the
other.</p>

<p>"Listen to this!" cried the Marchesa vivaciously.
She read it out. "He doesn't beat
about the bush, does he? I'm to surrender
before eight o'clock to-morrow morning!"</p>

<p>"Sounds rather a peremptory sort of a
chap!" observed Colonel Wenman.</p>

<p>"I," remarked Lady Norah, "shouldn't
so much as answer him, Helena."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall certainly answer him and tell
him that he'll trespass on my property at
his peril," said the Marchesa haughtily.
"Isn't that the right way to put it, Mr.
Stillford?"</p>

<p>"If it would be a trespass, that might be
one way to put it," was Stillford's professionally
cautious advice. "But as I ventured
to tell you when you determined to put on
the padlock, the rights in the matter are not
quite as clear as we could wish."</p>

<p>"When I bought this place, I bought a
private estate&mdash;a private estate, Mr. Stillford&mdash;for
myself&mdash;not a short cut for
Lord Lynborough! Am I to put up a
notice for him, 'This Way to the Bathing-Machines'?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stand it for a moment."
Captain Irons sounded bellicose.</p>

<p>Violet Dufaure was amicably inclined.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might give him leave to walk
through. It would be a bore for him to go
round by the road every time."</p>

<p>"Certainly I might give him leave if he
asked for it," retorted the Marchesa rather
sharply. "But he doesn't. He orders me to
open my gate&mdash;and tells me he means to
bathe! As if I cared whether he bathed or
not! What is it to me, I ask you, Violet,
whether the man bathes or not?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Marchesa, but aren't
you getting a little off the point?" Stillford
intervened deferentially.</p>

<p>"No, I'm not. I never get off the point,
Mr. Stillford. Do I, Colonel Wenman?"</p>

<p>"I've never known you to do it in my life,
Marchesa." There was, in fact, as Lynborough
had ventured to anticipate, a flush on
the Marchesa's cheek, and the Colonel
knew his place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, Mr. Stillford!" she cried triumphantly.
Then she swept&mdash;the expression
is really applicable&mdash;across the room to her
writing-table. "I shall be courteous, but
quite decisive," she announced over her
shoulder as she sat down.</p>

<p>Stillford stood by the fire, smiling doubtfully.
Evidently it was no use trying to stop
the Marchesa; she had insisted on locking
the gate, and she would persist in keeping
it locked till she was forced, by process of
law or otherwise, to open it again. But if the
Lords of Scarsmoor Castle really had used
it without interruption for fifty years (as
Lord Lynborough asserted)&mdash;well, the Marchesa's
rights were at least in a precarious
position.</p>

<p>The Marchesa came back with her letter
in her hand.</p>

<p>"'The Marchesa di San Servolo,'" she read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
out to an admiring audience, "'presents
her compliments to Lord Lynborough. The
Marchesa has no intention of removing the
padlock and other obstacles which have
been placed on the gate to prevent trespassing&mdash;either
by Lord Lynborough or by
anybody else. The Marchesa is not concerned
to know Lord Lynborough's plans in
regard to bathing or otherwise. Nab Grange;
13th June.'"</p>

<p>The Marchesa looked round on her friends
with a satisfied air.</p>

<p>"I call that good," she remarked. "Don't
you, Norah?"</p>

<p>"I don't like the last sentence."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Why, that'll make him angrier
than anything else! Please ring the
bell for me, Mr. Stillford; it's just behind
you."</p>

<p>The butler came back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who brought Lord Lynborough's letter?"
asked the Marchesa.</p>

<p>"I don't know who it is, your Excellency&mdash;one
of the upper servants at the Castle,
I think."</p>

<p>"How did he come to the house?"</p>

<p>"By the drive&mdash;from the south gate&mdash;I
believe, your Excellency."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," she declared, looking
positively dangerous. "Tell him to go back
the same way, and not by the&mdash;by what
Lord Lynborough chooses to call 'Beach
Path.' Here's a letter for him to take."</p>

<p>"Very good, your Excellency." The butler
received the letter and withdrew.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lady Norah, "rather funny
he should call it Beach Path, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's funny or not,
Norah, but I do know that I don't care what
he calls it. He may call it Piccadilly if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
likes, but it's my path all the same." As she
spoke she looked, somewhat defiantly, at
Mr. Stillford.</p>

<p>Violet Dufaure, whose delicate frame held
an indomitable and indeed pugnacious spirit,
appealed to Stillford; "Can't Helena have
him taken up if he trespasses?"</p>

<p>"Well, hardly, Miss Dufaure. The remedy
would lie in the civil courts."</p>

<p>"Shall I bring an action against him? Is
that it? Is that right?" cried the Marchesa.</p>

<p>"That's the ticket, eh, Stillford?" asked
the Colonel.</p>

<p>Stillford's position was difficult; he had
the greatest doubt about his client's case.</p>

<p>"Suppose you leave him to bring the
action?" he suggested. "When he does, we
can fully consider our position."</p>

<p>"But if he insists on using the path to-morrow?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll hardly do that," Stillford persuaded
her. "You'll probably get a letter
from him, asking for the name of your
solicitor. You will give him my name; I
shall obtain the name of his solicitor, and
we shall settle it between us&mdash;amicably, I
hope, but in any case without further personal
trouble to you, Marchesa."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Marchesa blankly. "That's
how it will be, will it?"</p>

<p>"That's the usual course&mdash;the proper
way of doing the thing."</p>

<p>"It may be proper; it sounds very dull,
Mr. Stillford. What if he does try to use the
path to-morrow&mdash;'in order to bathe' as
he's good enough to tell me?"</p>

<p>"If you're right about the path, then
you've the right to stop him," Stillford answered
rather reluctantly. "If you do stop
him, that, of course, raises the question in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
concrete form. You will offer a formal resistance.
He will make a formal protest.
Then the lawyers step in."</p>

<p>"We always end with the lawyers&mdash;and
my lawyer doesn't seem sure I'm right!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure," said Stillford
bluntly. "It's impossible to be sure at this
stage of the case."</p>

<p>"For all I see, he may use my path to-morrow!"
The Marchesa was justifying
her boast that she could stick to a point.</p>

<p>"Now that you've lodged your objection,
that won't matter much legally."</p>

<p>"It will annoy me intensely," the Marchesa
complained.</p>

<p>"Then we'll stop him," declared Colonel
Wenman valorously.</p>

<p>"Politely&mdash;but firmly," added Captain
Irons.</p>

<p>"And what do you say, Mr. Stillford?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go with these fellows anyhow&mdash;and
see that they don't overstep the law. No
more than the strictly necessary force, Colonel!"</p>

<p>"I begin to think that the law is rather
stupid," said the Marchesa. She thought it
stupid; Lynborough held it iniquitous; the
law was at a discount, and its majesty little
reverenced, that night.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, Stillford persuaded
the angry lady to&mdash;as he tactfully put it&mdash;give
Lynborough a chance. "See what he
does first. If he crosses the path now, after
warning, your case is clear. Write to him
again then, and tell him that, if he persists
in trespassing, your servants have orders to
interfere."</p>

<p>"That lets him bathe to-morrow!" Once
more the Marchesa returned to her point&mdash;a
very sore one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just for once, it really doesn't matter!"
Stillford urged.</p>

<p>Reluctantly she acquiesced; the others
were rather relieved&mdash;not because they
objected to a fight, but because eight in the
morning was rather early to start one.
Breakfast at the Grange was at nine-thirty,
and, though the men generally went down
for a dip, they went much later than Lord
Lynborough proposed to go.</p>

<p>"He shall have one chance of withdrawing
gracefully," the Marchesa finally
decided.</p>

<p>Stillford was unfeignedly glad to hear her
say so; he had, from a professional point of
view, no desire for a conflict. Inquiries which
he had made in Fillby&mdash;both from men in
Scarsmoor Castle employ and from independent
persons&mdash;had convinced him that
Lynborough's case was strong. For many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
years&mdash;through the time of two Lynboroughs
before the present at Scarsmoor,
and through the time of three Crosses (the
predecessors of the Marchesa) at Nab
Grange, Scarsmoor Castle had without
doubt asserted this dominant right over Nab
Grange. It had been claimed and exercised
openly&mdash;and, so far as he could discover,
without protest or opposition. The period,
as he reckoned it, would prove to be long
enough to satisfy the law as to prescription;
it was very unlikely that any document
existed&mdash;or anyhow could be found&mdash;which
would serve to explain away the presumption
which uses such as this gave. In
fine, the Marchesa's legal adviser was of
opinion that in a legal fight the Marchesa
would be beaten. His own hope lay in compromise;
if friendly relations could be established,
there would be a chance of a compro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>mise.
He was sure that the Marchesa would
readily grant as a favor&mdash;and would possibly
give in return for a nominal payment&mdash;all
that Lynborough asked. That would be the
best way out of the difficulty. "Let us temporize,
and be conciliatory," thought the man
of law.</p>

<p>Alas, neither conciliation nor dilatoriness
was in Lord Lynborough's line! He read the
Marchesa's letter with appreciation and
pleasure. He admired the curtness of its
intimation, and the lofty haughtiness with
which the writer dismissed the subject of his
bathing. But he treated the document&mdash;it
cannot be said that he did wrong&mdash;as a
plain defiance. It appeared to him that no
further declaration of war was necessary; he
was not concerned to consider evidence nor
to weigh his case, as Stillford wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
weigh her case. This for two reasons: first,
because he was entirely sure that he was
right; secondly because he had no intention
of bringing the question to trial. Lynborough
knew but one tribunal; he had pointed
out its local habitation to Roger Wilbraham.</p>

<p>Accordingly it fell out that conciliatory
counsels and Fabian tactics at Nab Grange
received a very severe&mdash;perhaps indeed a
fatal&mdash;shock the next morning.</p>

<p>At about nine o'clock the Marchesa was
sitting in her dressing-gown by the open
window, reading her correspondence and
sipping an early cup of tea&mdash;she had become
quite English in her habits. Her maid
rentered the room, carrying in her hand a
small parcel. "For your Excellency," she
said. "A man has just left it at the door."
She put the parcel down on the marble top
of the dressing-table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the Marchesa indolently.</p>

<p>"I don't know, your Excellency. It's hard,
and very heavy for its size."</p>

<p>Laying down the letter which she had been
perusing, the Marchesa took up the parcel
and cut the string which bound it. With a
metallic clink there fell on her dressing-table&mdash;a
padlock! To it was fastened a piece of
paper, bearing these words: "Padlock found
attached to gate leading to Beach Path.
Detached by order of Lord Lynborough.
With Lord Lynborough's compliments."</p>

<p>Now, too, Lynborough might have got
his flush&mdash;if he could have been there to
see it!</p>

<p>"Bring me my field-glasses!" she cried.</p>

<p>The window commanded a view of the
gardens, of the meadows beyond the sunk
fence, of the path&mdash;Beach Path as that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
was pleased to call it!&mdash;and of the gate.
At the last-named object the enraged Marchesa
directed her gaze. The barricade of
furze branches was gone! The gate hung
open upon its hinges!</p>

<p>While she still looked, three figures came
across the lens. A very large stout shape&mdash;a
short spare form&mdash;a tall, lithe, very lean
figure. They were just reaching the gate,
coming from the direction of the sea. The
two first were strangers to her; the third she
had seen for a moment the afternoon before
on Sandy Nab. It was Lynborough himself,
beyond a doubt. The others must be friends&mdash;she
cared not about them. But to sit here
with the padlock before her, and see Lynborough
pass through the gate&mdash;a meeker
woman than she had surely been moved to
wrath! He had bathed&mdash;as he had said he
would. And he had sent her the padlock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
That was what came of listening to conciliatory
counsels, of letting herself give ear
to dilatory persuasions!</p>

<p>"War!" declared the Marchesa. "War&mdash;war&mdash;war!
And if he's not careful, I
won't confine it to the path either!" She
seemed to dream of conquests, perhaps to
reckon resources, whereof Mr. Stillford, her
legal adviser, had taken no account.</p>

<p>She carried the padlock down to breakfast
with her; it was to her as a Fiery Cross; it
summoned her and her array to battle. She
exhibited it to her guests.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, I'm in your hands!"
said she. "Is that man to walk over my
property for his miserable bathing to-morrow?"</p>

<p>He would have been a bold man who,
at that moment, would have answered her
with a "Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_Five" id="Chapter_Five"></a><i>Chapter Five</i></h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNING OF WAR</h3>


<p>An enviable characteristic of Lord Lynborough's
was that, when he had laid the
fuse, he could wait patiently for the explosion.
(That last word tends to recur in connection
with him.) Provided he knew that
his adventure and his joke were coming,
he occupied the interval profitably&mdash;which
is to say, as agreeably as he could. Having
launched the padlock&mdash;his symbolical ultimatum&mdash;and
asserted his right, he spent
the morning in dictating to Roger Wilbraham
a full, particular, and veracious account of
his early differences with the Dean of Christ
Church. Roger found his task entertaining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
for Lynborough's mimicry of his distinguished
opponent was excellent. Stabb meanwhile
was among the tombs in an adjacent apartment.</p>

<p>This studious tranquillity was disturbed
by the announcement of a call from Mr.
Stillford. Not without difficulty he had persuaded
the Marchesa to let him reconnoiter
the ground&mdash;to try, if it seemed desirable,
the effect of a bit of "bluff"&mdash;at any rate
to discover, if he could, something of the
enemy's plan of campaign. Stillford was,
in truth, not a little afraid of a lawsuit!</p>

<p>Lynborough denied himself to no man,
and received with courtesy every man who
came. But his face grew grim and his manner
distant when Stillford discounted the
favorable effect produced by his appearance
and manner&mdash;also by his name, well
known in the county&mdash;by confessing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
he called in the capacity of the Marchesa's
solicitor.</p>

<p>"A solicitor?" said Lynborough, slightly
raising his brows.</p>

<p>"Yes. The Marchesa does me the honor
to place her confidence in me; and it occurs
to me that, before this unfortunate dispute&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why unfortunate?" interrupted Lynborough
with an air of some surprise.</p>

<p>"Surely it is&mdash;between neighbors? The
Castle and the Grange should be friends."
His cunning suggestion elicited no response.
"It occurred to me," he continued, somewhat
less glibly, "that, before further annoyance
or expense was caused, it might be
well if I talked matters over with your
lordship's solicitor."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Lynborough, "saving your
presence&mdash;which, I must beg you to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>member,
was not invited by me&mdash;I don't
like solicitors. I have no solicitor. I shall
never have a solicitor. You can't talk with a
non-existent person."</p>

<p>"But proceedings are the natural&mdash;the
almost inevitable&mdash;result of such a situation
as your action has created, Lord Lynborough.
My client can't be flouted, she
can't have her indubitable rights outraged&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you think they're indubitable?"
Lynborough put in, with a sudden quick
flash of his eyes.</p>

<p>For an instant Stillford hesitated. Then
he made his orthodox reply. "As I am instructed,
they certainly are."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lynborough dryly.</p>

<p>"No professional man could say more
than that, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"And they all say just as much! If I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
anything you don't like, again remember
that this interview is not of my seeking,
Mr. Stillford."</p>

<p>Stillford waxed a trifle sarcastic. "You'll
conduct your case in person?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If you hale me to court, I shall. Otherwise
there's no question of a case."</p>

<p>This time Stillford's eyes brightened; yet
still he doubted Lynborough's meaning.</p>

<p>"We shouldn't hesitate to take our case
into court."</p>

<p>"Since you're wrong, you'd probably
win," said Lynborough, with a smile. "But
I'd make it cost you the devil of a lot of
money. That, at least, the law can do&mdash;I'm
not aware that it can do much else.
But as far as I'm concerned, I should
as soon appeal to the Pope of Rome in
this matter as to a law-court&mdash;sooner in
fact."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Stillford grew more confidently happy&mdash;and
more amazed at Lynborough.</p>

<p>"But you've no right to&mdash;er&mdash;assert
rights if you don't intend to support them."</p>

<p>"I do intend to support them, Mr. Stillford.
That you'll very soon find out."</p>

<p>"By force?" Stillford himself was gratified
by the shocked solemnity which he
achieved in this question.</p>

<p>"If so, your side has no prejudice against
legal proceedings. Prisons are not strange
to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?" Stillford was a little startled.
He had not heard all the stories about Lord
Lynborough.</p>

<p>"I say, prisons are not strange to me. If
necessary, I can do a month. I am, however,
not altogether a novice in the somewhat
degrading art of getting the other man to hit
first. Then he goes to prison, doesn't he?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Just like the law! As if that had anything
to do with the merits!"</p>

<p>Stillford kept his eye on the point valuable
to him. "By supporting your claim I intended
to convey supporting it by legal action."</p>

<p>"Oh, the cunning of this world, the cunning
of this world, Roger!" He flung himself
into an arm-chair, laughing. Stillford was
already seated. "Take a cigarette, Mr.
Stillford. You want to know whether I'm
going to law or not, don't you? Well, I'm
not. Is there anything else you want to
know? Oh, by the way, we don't abstain
from the law because we don't know the law.
Permit me&mdash;Mr. Stillford, solicitor&mdash;Mr.
Roger Wilbraham, of the Middle Temple,
Esquire, barrister-at-law. Had I known
you were coming, Roger should have worn
his wig. No, no, we know the law&mdash;but
we hate it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Stillford was jubilant at a substantial
gain&mdash;the appeal to law lay within the Marchesa's
choice now; and that was in his
view a great advantage. But he was legitimately
irritated by Lynborough's sneers at
his profession.</p>

<p>"So do most of the people who belong to&mdash;the
people to whom prisons are not
strange, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"Apostles&mdash;and so on?" asked Lynborough
airily.</p>

<p>"I hardly recognize your lordship as belonging
to that&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;category."</p>

<p>"That's the worst of it&mdash;nobody will,"
Lynborough admitted candidly. A note of
sincere, if whimsical, regret sounded in his
voice. "I've been trying for fifteen years.
Yet some day I may be known as St. Ambrose!"
His tones fell to despondency again.
"St. Ambrose the Less, though&mdash;yes, I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
afraid the Less. Apostles&mdash;even Saints&mdash;are
much handicapped in these days, Mr.
Stillford."</p>

<p>Stillford rose to his feet. "You've no more
to say to me, Lord Lynborough?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that I ever had anything
to say to you, Mr. Stillford. You must have
gathered before now that I intend to use
Beach Path."</p>

<p>"My client intends to prevent you."</p>

<p>"Yes?&mdash;Well, you're three able-bodied
men down there&mdash;so my man tells me&mdash;you,
and the Colonel, and the Captain.
And we're three up here. It seems to me fair
enough."</p>

<p>"You don't really contemplate settling
the matter by personal conflict?" He was
half amused, yet genuinely stricken in his
habits of thought.</p>

<p>"Entirely a question for your side. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
shall use the path." Lynborough cocked
his head on one side, looking up at the sturdy
lawyer with a mischievous amusement. "I
shall harry you, Mr. Stillford&mdash;day and
night I shall harry you. If you mean to keep
me off that path, vigils will be your portion.
And you won't succeed."</p>

<p>"I make a last appeal to your lordship.
The matter could, I believe, be adjusted
on an amicable basis. The Marchesa
could be prevailed upon to grant permission&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon ask her permission to
breathe," interrupted Lynborough.</p>

<p>"Then my mission is at an end."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

<p>"Well, you've found out the chief thing
you wanted to know, haven't you? If you'd
asked it point-blank, we should have saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
a lot of time. Good-by, Mr. Stillford. Roger,
the bell's in reach of your hand."</p>

<p>"You're pleased to be amused at my
expense?" Stillford had grown huffy.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;only don't think you've been
clever at mine," Lynborough retorted
placidly.</p>

<p>So they parted. Lynborough went back
to his Dean, Stillford to the Marchesa.
Still ruffled in his plumes, feeling that he
had been chaffed and had made no adequate
reply, yet still happy in the solid, the important
fact which he had ascertained, he
made his report to his client. He refrained
from openly congratulating her on not being
challenged to a legal fight; he contented
himself with observing that it was convenient
to be able to choose her own time
to take proceedings.</p>

<p>Lady Norah was with the Marchesa. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
both listened attentively and questioned
closely. Not the substantial points alone attracted
their interest; Stillford was constantly
asked&mdash;"How did he look when he said
that?" He had no other answer than "Oh&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;rather
queer." He left them,
having received directions to rebarricade the
gate as solidly and as offensively as possible;
a board warning off trespassers was also
to be erected.</p>

<p>Although not apt at a description of his
interlocutor, yet Stillford seemed to have
conveyed an impression.</p>

<p>"I think he must be delightful," said
Norah thoughtfully, when the two ladies
were left together. "I'm sure he's just the
sort of a man I should fall in love with,
Helena."</p>

<p>As a rule the Marchesa admired and applauded
Norah's candor, praising it for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
certain patrician flavor&mdash;Norah spoke her
mind, let the crowd think what it would!
On this occasion she was somehow less
pleased; she was even a little startled. She
was conscious that any man with whom
Norah was gracious enough to fall in love
would be subjected to no ordinary assault;
the Irish coloring is bad to beat, and Norah
had it to perfection; moreover, the aforesaid
candor makes matters move ahead.</p>

<p>"After all, it's my path he's trespassing on,
Norah," the Marchesa remonstrated.</p>

<p>They both began to laugh. "The wretch
is as handsome as&mdash;as a god," sighed
Helena.</p>

<p>"You've seen him?" eagerly questioned
Norah; and the glimpse&mdash;that tantalizing
glimpse&mdash;on Sandy Nab was confessed to.</p>

<p>The Marchesa sprang up, clenching her
fist. "Norah, I should like to have that man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
at my feet, and then to trample on him!
Oh, it's not only the path! I believe he's
laughing at me all the time!"</p>

<p>"He's never seen you. Perhaps if he
did he wouldn't laugh. And perhaps you
wouldn't trample on him either."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I would!" She tossed her head
impatiently. "Well, if you want to meet
him. I expect you can do it&mdash;on my path
to-morrow!"</p>

<p>This talk left the Marchesa vaguely
vexed. Her feeling could not be called jealousy;
nothing can hardly be jealous of
nothing, and even as her acquaintance with
Lynborough amounted to nothing, Lady
Norah's also was represented by a cipher.
But why should Norah want to know him?
It was the Marchesa's path&mdash;by consequence
it was the Marchesa's quarrel.
Where did Norah stand in the matter? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
Marchesa had perhaps been constructing
a little drama. Norah took leave to introduce
a new character!</p>

<p>And not Norah alone, as it appeared at
dinner. Little Violet Dufaure, whose appealing
ways were notoriously successful
with the emotionally weaker sex, took her
seat at table with a demurely triumphant air.
Captain Irons reproached her, with polite
gallantry, for having deserted the croquet
lawn after tea.</p>

<p>"Oh, I went for a walk to Fillby&mdash;through
Scarsmoor, you know."</p>

<p>"Through Scarsmoor, Violet?" The Marchesa
sounded rather startled again.</p>

<p>"It's a public road, you know, Helena.
Isn't it, Mr. Stillford?"</p>

<p>Stillford admitted that it was. "All the
same, perhaps the less we go there at the
present moment&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but Lord Lynborough asked me to
come again and to go wherever I liked&mdash;not
to keep to the stupid road."</p>

<p>Absolute silence reigned. Violet looked
round with a smile which conveyed a general
appeal for sympathy; there was, perhaps,
special reference to Miss Gilletson as the
guardian of propriety, and to the Marchesa
as the owner of the disputed path.</p>

<p>"You see, I took Nellie, and the dear always
does run away. She ran after a rabbit.
I ran after her, of course. The rabbit ran
into a hole, and I ran into Lord Lynborough.
Helena, he's charming!"</p>

<p>"I'm thoroughly tired of Lord Lynborough,"
said the Marchesa icily.</p>

<p>"He must have known I was staying with
you, I think; but he never so much as mentioned
you. He just ignored you&mdash;the
whole thing, I mean. Wasn't it tactful?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Tactful it might have been; it did not appear
to gratify the Marchesa.</p>

<p>"What a wonderful air there is about a&mdash;a
<i>grand seigneio</i>!" pursued Violet reflectively.
"Such a difference it makes!"</p>

<p>That remark did not gratify any of the
gentlemen present; it implied a contrast,
although it might not definitely assert one.</p>

<p>"It is such a pity that you've quarreled
about that silly path!"</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! Miss Dufaure!"&mdash;"I say
come, Miss Dufaure!"&mdash;"Er&mdash;really,
Miss Dufaure!"&mdash;these three remonstrances
may be distributed indifferently among
the three men. They felt that there was a risk
of treason in the camp.</p>

<p>The Marchesa assumed her grandest manner;
it was medieval&mdash;it was Titianesque.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, as it seems, Violet, I do not
rely on your help to maintain my fights in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
regard to the path. Pray meet Lord Lynborough
as often as you please, but spare me
any unnecessary mention of his name."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean any harm. It was all
Nellie's fault."</p>

<p>The Marchesa's reply&mdash;if such it can be
called&mdash;was delivered <i>sotto voce</i>, yet was
distinctly audible. It was also brief. She
said "<i>Nellie</i>!" Nellie was, of course, Miss
Dufaure's dog.</p>

<p>Night fell upon an apparently peaceful
land. Yet Violet was an absentee from the
Marchesa's dressing-room that night, and
even between Norah and her hostess the
conversation showed a tendency to flag.
Norah, for all her courage, dared not mention
the name of Lynborough, and Helena
most plainly would not. Yet what else was
there to talk about? It had come to that
point even so early in the war!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, up at Scarsmoor Castle, Lynborough,
in exceedingly high spirits, talked
to Leonard Stabb.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cromlech," he said, "a pretty
girl, a very pretty girl if you like that <i>petite</i>
insinuating style. For myself I prefer something
a shade more&mdash;what shall we call
it?"</p>

<p>"Don't care a hang," muttered Stabb.</p>

<p>"A trifle more in the grand manner,
perhaps, Cromlech. And she hadn't anything
like the complexion. I knew at once that it
couldn't be the Marchesa. Do you bathe to-morrow
morning?"</p>

<p>"And get my head broken?"</p>

<p>"Just stand still, and let them throw
themselves against you, Cromlech. Roger!&mdash;Oh,
he's gone to bed; stupid thing to do&mdash;that!
Cromlech, old chap, I'm enjoying
myself immensely."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>He just touched his old friend's shoulder
as he passed by: the caress was almost imperceptible.
Stabb turned his broad red
face round to him and laughed ponderously.</p>

<p>"Oh, and you understand!" cried Lynborough.</p>

<p>"I have never myself objected to a bit of
fun with the girls," said Stabb.</p>

<p>Lynborough sank into a chair murmuring
delightedly, "You're priceless, Cromlech!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_Six" id="Chapter_Six"></a><i>Chapter Six</i></h2>

<h3>EXERCISE BEFORE BREAKFAST</h3>


<p>"Life&mdash;" (The extract is from Lynborough's
diary, dated this same 14th of June)&mdash;"may
be considered as a process (Cromlech's
view, conducting to the tomb)&mdash;a
program (as, I am persuaded, Roger conceives
it, marking off each stage thereof
with a duly guaranteed stamp of performance)&mdash;or
as a progress&mdash;in which light
I myself prefer to envisage it. Process&mdash;program&mdash;progress;
the words, with my
above-avowed preference, sound unimpeachably
orthodox. Once I had a Bishop ancestor.
He crops out.</p>

<p>"Yet I don't mean what he does. I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
believe in growing better in the common
sense&mdash;that is, in an increasing power to
resist what tempts you, to refrain from doing
what you want. That ideal seems to me,
more and more, to start from the wrong end.
No man refrains from doing what he wants
to do. In the end the contradiction&mdash;the
illogicality&mdash;is complete. You learn to
want more wisely&mdash;that's all. Train desire,
for you can never chain it.</p>

<p>"I'm engaged here and now on what is
to all appearance the most trivial of businesses.
I play the spiteful boy&mdash;she is an
obstinate peevish girl. There are other girls
too&mdash;one an insinuating tiny minx, who
would wheedle a backward glance out of
Simon Stylites as he remounted his pillar&mdash;and,
by the sun in heaven, will get little
more from this child of Mother Earth!
There's another, I hear&mdash;Irish!&mdash;And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Irish is near my heart. But behind her&mdash;set
in the uncertain radiance of my imagination&mdash;lies
her Excellency. Heaven knows why!
Save that it is gloriously paradoxical to meet
a foreign Excellency in this spot, and to get
to most justifiable, most delightful, loggerheads
with her immediately. I have conceived
Machiavellian devices. I will lure
away her friends. I will isolate her, humiliate
her, beat her in the fight. There may be
some black eyes&mdash;some bruised hearts&mdash;but
I shall do it. Why? I have always been
gentle before. But so I feel toward her.
And therefore I am afraid. This is the
foeman for my steel, I think&mdash;I have
my doubts but that she'll beat me in the
end.</p>

<p>"When I talk like this, Cromlech chuckles,
loves me as a show, despises me as a mind.
Roger&mdash;young Roger Fitz-Archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>&mdash;is
all an incredulous amazement. I don't
wonder. There is nothing so small and
nothing so great&mdash;nothing so primitive
and not a thing so complex&mdash;nothing so unimportant
and so engrossing as this 'duel
of the sexes.' A proves it a trifle, and is held
great. B reckons it all-supreme, and becomes
popular. C (a woman) describes the Hunter
Man. D (a man) descants of the Pursuit by
Woman. The oldest thing is the most canvassed
and the least comprehended. But
there's a reputation&mdash;and I suppose money&mdash;in
it for anybody who can string phrases.
There's blood-red excitement for everybody
who can feel. Yet I've played my part
in other affairs&mdash;not so much in dull old
England, where you work five years to become
a Member of Parliament, and five
years more in order to get kicked out again&mdash;but
in places where in a night you rise or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
fall&mdash;in five minutes order the shooting-squad
or face it&mdash;boil the cook or are stuffed
into the pot yourself. (Cromlech, this is not
exact scientific statement!) Yet always&mdash;everywhere&mdash;the
woman! And why? On
my honor, I don't know. What in the end
is she?</p>

<p>"I adjourn the question&mdash;and put a
broader one. What am I? The human being
as such? If I'm a vegetable, am I not a mistake?
If I'm an animal, am I not a cruelty?
If I'm a soul, am I not misplaced? I'd say
'Yes' to all this, save that I enjoy myself so
much. Because I have forty thousand a
year? Hardly. I've had nothing, and been as
completely out of reach of getting anything
as the veriest pauper that ever existed&mdash;and
yet I've had the deuce of a fine existence
the while. I think there's only one solid
blunder been made about man&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
oughtn't to have been able to think. It wastes
time. It makes many people unhappy. That's
not my case. I like it. It just wastes time.</p>

<p>"That insinuating minx, possessed of a
convenient dog and an ingratiating manner,
insinuated to-day that I was handsome.
Well, she's pretty, and I suppose we're both
better off for it. It is an introduction. But
to myself I don't seem very handsome. I
have my pride&mdash;I look a gentleman. But
I look a queer foreign fish. I found myself
envying the British robustness of that fine
young chap who is so misguided as to be a
lawyer.</p>

<p>"Ah, why do I object to lawyers? Tolstoi!&mdash;I
used to say&mdash;or, at the risk of
advanced intellects not recognizing one's
allusions, one could go further back. But
that is, in the end, all gammon. Every real
conviction springs from personal experience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
I hate the law because it interfered with me.
I'm not aware of any better reason. So I'm
going on without it&mdash;unless somebody tries
to steal my forty thousand, of course. Ambrose,
thou art a humbug&mdash;or, more precisely,
thou canst not avoid being a human
individual!"</p>

<p>Lord Lynborough completed the entry
in his diary&mdash;he was tolerably well aware
that he might just as well not have written
it&mdash;and cast his eyes toward the window
of the library. The stars were bright; a
crescent moon decorated, without illuminating,
the sky. The regular recurrent beat of
the sea on the shore, traversing the interval
in night's silence, struck on his ear. "If
God knew Time, that might be His clock,"
said he. "Listen to its inexorable, peaceable,
gentle, formidable stroke!"</p>

<p>His sleep that night was short and broken.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
A fitful excitement was on his spirit: the
glory of the summer morning wooed his
restlessness. He would take his swim alone,
and early. At six o'clock he slipped out of
the house and made for Beach Path. The
fortified gate was too strong for his unaided
efforts. Roger Wilbraham had told him
that, if the way were impeded, he had a
right to "deviate." He deviated now, lightly
vaulting over the four-foot-high stone wall.
None was there to hinder him, and, with
emotions appropriate to the occasion, he
passed Nab Grange and gained the beach.
When once he was in the water, the emotions
went away.</p>

<p>They were to return&mdash;or, at any rate, to
be succeeded by their brethren. After he had
dressed, he sat down and smoked a cigarette
as he regarded the smiling sea. This situation
was so agreeable that he prolonged it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
full half-an-hour; then a sudden longing for
Coltson's coffee came over him. He jumped
up briskly and made for the Grange gate.</p>

<p>He had left it open&mdash;it was shut now.
None had been nigh when he passed through.
Now a young woman in a white frock leant
her elbows comfortably on its top rail and
rested her pretty chin upon her hands.
Lady Norah's blue eyes looked at him
serenely from beneath black lashes of
noticeable length&mdash;at any rate Lynborough
noticed their length.</p>

<p>Lynborough walked up to the gate. With
one hand he removed his hat, with the other
he laid a tentative hand on the latch. Norah
did not move or even smile.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madam," said Lynborough,
"but if it does not incommode you,
would you have the great kindness to permit
me to open the gate?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry; but this is a private path
leading to Nab Grange. I suppose you're a
stranger in these parts?"</p>

<p>"My name is Lynborough. I live at Scarsmoor
there."</p>

<p>"Are you Lord Lynborough?" Norah
sounded exceedingly interested. "<i>The</i> Lord
Lynborough?"</p>

<p>"There's only one, so far as I'm aware,"
the owner of the title answered.</p>

<p>"I mean the one who has done all those&mdash;those&mdash;well,
those funny things?"</p>

<p>"I rejoice if the recital of them has caused
you any amusement. And now, if you will
permit me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can't! Helena would never
forgive me. I'm a friend of hers, you know&mdash;of
the Marchesa di San Servolo. Really
you can't come through here."</p>

<p>"Do you think you can stop me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"There isn't room for you to get over as
long as I stand here&mdash;and the wall's too
high to climb, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Lynborough studied the wall; it was twice
the height of the wall on the other side; it
might be possible to scale, but difficult and
laborious; nor would he look imposing while
struggling at the feat.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go round by the road,"
remarked Norah, breaking into a smile.</p>

<p>Lynborough was enjoying the conversation
just as much as she was&mdash;but he wanted
two things; one was victory, the other
coffee.</p>

<p>"Can't I persuade you to move?" he said
imploringly. "I really don't want to have to
resort to more startling measures."</p>

<p>"You surely wouldn't use force against
a girl, Lord Lynborough!"</p>

<p>"I said startling measures&mdash;not violent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ones," he reminded her. "Are your nerves
good?"</p>

<p>"Excellent, thank you."</p>

<p>"You mean to stand where you are?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;till you've gone away." Now she
laughed openly at him. Lynborough delighted
in the merry sound and the flash of
her white teeth.</p>

<p>"It's a splendid morning, isn't it?" he
asked. "I should think you stand about five
feet five, don't you? By the way, whom have
I the pleasure of conversing with?"</p>

<p>"My name is Norah Mountliffey."</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew your father very well." He
drew back a few steps. "So you must excuse
an old family friend for telling you that you
make a charming picture at that gate. If I
had a camera&mdash;Just as you are, please!"
He held up his hand, as though to pose her.</p>

<p>"Am I quite right?" she asked, humoring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the joke, with her merry mischievous eyes
set on Lynborough's face as she leaned over
the top of the gate.</p>

<p>"Quite right. Now, please! Don't move!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've no intention of moving,"
laughed Norah mockingly.</p>

<p>She kept her word; perhaps she was too
surprised to do anything else. For Lynborough,
clapping his hat on firmly, with a dart
and a spring flew over her head.</p>

<p>Then she wheeled round&mdash;to see him
standing two yards from her, his hat in his
hand again, bowing apologetically.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for getting between you and
the sunshine for a moment," he said. "But
I thought I could still do five feet five; and
you weren't standing upright either. I've
done within an inch of six feet, you know.
And now I'm afraid I must reluctantly ask
you to excuse me. I thank you for the plea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>sure
of this conversation." He bowed, put on
his hat, turned, and began to walk away
along Beach Path.</p>

<p>"You got the better of me that time, but
you've not done with me yet," she cried,
starting after him.</p>

<p>He turned and looked over his shoulder:
save for his eyes his face was quite grave.
He quickened his pace to a very rapid walk.
Norah found that she must run, or fall
behind. She began to run. Again that gravely
derisory face turned upon her. She blushed,
and fell suddenly to wondering whether in
running she looked absurd. She fell to a
walk. Lynborough seemed to know. Without
looking round again, he abated his pace.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't catch you if you won't
stop!" she cried.</p>

<p>"My friend and secretary, Roger Wilbraham,
tells me that I have no right to stop,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Lynborough explained, looking round again,
but not standing still. "I have only the right
to pass and repass. I'm repassing now. He's
a barrister, and he says that's the law. I
daresay it is&mdash;but I regret that it prevents
me from obliging you, Lady Norah."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to make a fool of
myself by running after you," said Norah
crossly.</p>

<p>Lynborough walked slowly on; Norah
followed; they reached the turn of the path
towards the Grange hall door. They reached
it&mdash;and passed it&mdash;both of them. Lynborough
turned once more&mdash;with a surprised
lift of his brows.</p>

<p>"At least I can see you safe off the premises!"
laughed Norah, and with a quick
dart forward she reduced the distance between
them to half-a-yard. Lynborough
seemed to have no objection; proximity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
made conversation easier; he moved slowly
on.</p>

<p>Norah seemed defeated&mdash;but suddenly
she saw her chance, and hailed it with a cry.
The Marchesa's bailiff&mdash;John Goodenough&mdash;was
approaching the path from the house
situated at the southwest corner of the
meadow. Her cry of his name caught his
attention&mdash;as well as Lynborough's. The
latter walked a little quicker. John Goodenough
hurried up. Lynborough walked
steadily on.</p>

<p>"Stop him, John!" cried Norah, her eyes
sparkling with new excitement. "You know
her Excellency's orders? This is Lord Lynborough!"</p>

<p>"His lordship! Aye, it is. I beg your pardon,
my lord, but&mdash;I'm very sorry to interfere
with your lordship, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're in my way, Goodenough." For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
John had got across his path, and barred
progress. "Of course I must stand still if
you impede my steps, but I do it under
protest. I only want to repass."</p>

<p>"You can't come this way, my lord. I'm
sorry, but it's her Excellency's strict orders.
You must go back, my lord."</p>

<p>"I am going back&mdash;or I was till you
stopped me."</p>

<p>"Back to where you came from, my lord."</p>

<p>"I came from Scarsmoor and I'm going
back there, Goodenough."</p>

<p>"Where you came from last, my lord."</p>

<p>"No, no, Goodenough. At all events, her
Excellency has no right to drive me into the
sea." Lynborough's tone was plaintively
expostulatory.</p>

<p>"Then if you won't go back, my lord,
here we stay!" said John, bewildered but
faithfully obstinate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just your tactics!" Lynborough observed
to Norah, a keen spectator of the scene. "But
I'm not so patient of them from Goodenough."</p>

<p>"I don't know that you were very patient
with me."</p>

<p>"Goodenough, if you use sufficient force
I shall, of course, be prevented from continuing
on my way. Nothing short of that,
however, will stop me. And pray take care
that the force is sufficient&mdash;neither more
nor less than sufficient, Goodenough."</p>

<p>"I don't want to use no violence to your
lordship. Well now, if I lay my hand on
your lordship's shoulder, will that do to
satisfy your lordship?"</p>

<p>"I don't know until you try it."</p>

<p>John's face brightened. "I reckon that's
the way out. I reckon that's law, my lord.
I puts my hand on your lordship's shoulder
like that&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>He suited the action to the word. In an
instant Lynborough's long lithe arms were
round him, Lynborough's supple lean leg
twisted about his. Gently, as though he had
been a little baby, Lynborough laid the
sturdy fellow on the grass.</p>

<p>For all she could do, Norah Mountliffey
cried "Bravo!" and clapped her hands.
Goodenough sat up, scratched his head, and
laughed feebly.</p>

<p>"Force not quite sufficient, Goodenough,"
cried Lynborough gaily. "Now I repass!"</p>

<p>He lifted his hat to Norah, then waved
his hand. In her open impulsive way she
kissed hers back to him as he turned away.</p>

<p>By one of those accidents peculiar to
tragedy, the Marchesa's maid, performing
her toilet at an upper window, saw this
nefarious and traitorous deed!</p>

<p>"Swimming&mdash;jumping&mdash;wrestling! A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
good morning's exercise! And all before
those lazy chaps, Roger and Cromlech, are
out of bed!"</p>

<p>So saying, Lord Lynborough vaulted the
wall again in high good humor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<h3>ANOTHER WEDGE!</h3>


<p>Deprived of their leader's inspiration, the
other two representatives of Scarsmoor did
not brave the Passage Perilous to the sea
that morning. Lynborough was well content
to forego further aggression for the moment.
His words declared his satisfaction&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have driven a wedge&mdash;another wedge&mdash;into
the Marchesa's phalanx. Yes, I
think I may say a second wedge. Disaffection
has made its entry into Nab Grange, Cromlech.
The process of isolation has begun.
Perhaps after lunch we will resume operations."</p>

<p>But fortune was to give him an opportun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>ity
even before lunch. It appeared that
Stabb had sniffed out the existence of two
old brasses in Fillby Church; he was determined
to inspect them at the earliest possible
moment. Lynborough courteously offered
to accompany him, and they set out
together about eleven o'clock.</p>

<p>No incident marked their way. Lynborough
rang up the parish clerk at his
house, presented Stabb to that important
functionary, and bespoke for him every consideration.
Then he leaned against the outside
of the churchyard wall, peacefully
smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the village street
stood the Lynborough Arms. The inn was
kept by a very superior man, who had retired
to this comparative leisure after some years
of service as butler with Lynborough's
father. This excellent person, perceiving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Lynborough, crossed the road and invited
him to partake of a glass of ale in memory
of old days. Readily acquiescing, Lynborough
crossed the road, sat down with the
landlord on a bench by the porch, and began
to discuss local affairs over the beer.</p>

<p>"I suppose you haven't kept up your
cricket since you've been in foreign parts,
my lord?" asked Dawson, the landlord,
after some conversation which need not
occupy this narrative. "We're playing a
team from Easthorpe to-morrow, and we're
very short."</p>

<p>"Haven't played for nearly fifteen years,
Dawson. But I tell you what&mdash;I daresay
my friend Mr. Wilbraham will play. Mr.
Stabb's no use."</p>

<p>"Every one helps," said Dawson. "We've
got two of the gentlemen from the Grange&mdash;Mr.
Stillford, a good bat, and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Irons, who can bowl a bit&mdash;or so John
Goodenough tells me."</p>

<p>Lynborough's eyes had grown alert. "Well,
I used to bowl a bit, too. If you're really
hard up for a man, Dawson&mdash;really at a
loss, you know&mdash;I'll play. It'll be better
than going into the field short, won't it?"</p>

<p>Dawson was profuse in his thanks. Lynborough
listened patiently.</p>

<p>"I tell you what I should like to do,
Dawson," he said. "I should like to stand
the lunch."</p>

<p>It was the turn of Dawson's eyes to grow
alert. They did. Dawson supplied the lunch.
The club's finances were slender, and its
ideas correspondingly modest. But if Lord
Lynborough "stood" the lunch&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>"And to do it really well," added that
nobleman. "A sort of little feast to celebrate
my homecoming. The two teams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&mdash;and
perhaps a dozen places for friends&mdash;ladies,
the Vicar, and so on, eh, Dawson?
Do you see the idea?"</p>

<p>Dawson saw the idea much more clearly
than he saw most ideas. Almost corporeally
he beheld the groaning board.</p>

<p>"On such an occasion, Dawson, we
shouldn't quarrel about figures."</p>

<p>"Your lordship's always most liberal,"
Dawson acknowledged in tones which showed
some trace of emotion.</p>

<p>"Put the matter in hand at once. But
look here, I don't want it talked about.
Just tell the secretary of the club&mdash;that's
enough. Keep the tent empty till the moment
comes. Then display your triumph!
It'll be a pleasant little surprise for everybody,
won't it?"</p>

<p>Dawson thought it would; at any rate
it was one for him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>At this instant an elderly lady of demure
appearance was observed, to walk up to the
lych-gate and enter the churchyard. Lynborough
inquired of his companion who
she was.</p>

<p>"That's Miss Gilletson from the Grange,
my lord&mdash;the Marchesa's companion."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Lynborough softly. "Oh,
is it indeed?" He rose from his seat. "Good-by,
Dawson. Mind&mdash;a dead secret, and
a rattling good lunch!"</p>

<p>"I'll attend to it, my lord," Dawson assured
him with the utmost cheerfulness.
Never had Dawson invested a glass of beer
to better profit!</p>

<p>Lynborough threw away his cigar and
entered the sacred precincts. His brain
was very busy. "Another wedge!" he was
saying to himself. "Another wedge!"</p>

<p>The lady had gone into the church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Lynborough went in too. He came first on
Stabb&mdash;on his hands and knees, examining
one of the old brasses and making copious
notes in a pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Have you seen a lady come in, Cromlech?"
asked Lord Lynborough.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Cromlech, now
producing a yard measure and proceeding
to ascertain the dimensions of the brass.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't, if it were Venus herself,"
replied Lynborough pleasantly. "Well, I
must look for her on my own account."</p>

<p>He found her in the neighborhood of his
family monuments which, with his family
pew, crowded the little chancel of the church.
She was not employed in devotions, but was
arranging some flowers in a vase&mdash;doubtless
a pious offering. Somewhat at a loss
how to open the conversation, Lynborough
dropped his hat&mdash;or rather gave it a dex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>terous
jerk, so that it fell at the lady's feet.
Miss Gilletson started violently, and Lord
Lynborough humbly apologized. Thence
he glided into conversation, first about the
flowers, then about the tombs. On the latter
subject he was exceedingly interesting and
informing.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear! Married the Duke of Dexminster's
daughter, did he?" said Miss
Gilletson, considerably thrilled. "She's not
buried here, is she?"</p>

<p>"No, she's not," said Lynborough, suppressing
the fact that the lady had run away
after six months of married life. "And my
own father's not buried here, either; he
chose my mother's family place in Devonshire.
I thought it rather a pity."</p>

<p>"Your own father?" Miss Gilletson
gasped.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you didn't know me," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
said, laughing. "I'm Lord Lynborough, you
know. That's how I come to be so well up in
all this. And I tell you what&mdash;I should like
to show you some of our Scarsmoor roses
on your way home."</p>

<p>"Oh, but if you're Lord Lynborough, I&mdash;I
really couldn't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's to know anything about it, unless
you choose, Miss Gilletson?" he asked
with his ingratiating smile and his merry
twinkle. "There's nothing so pleasant as a
secret shared with a lady!"</p>

<p>It was a long time since a handsome man
had shared a secret with Miss Gilletson.
Who knows, indeed, whether such a thing
had ever happened? Or whether Miss
Gilletson had once just dreamed that some
day it might&mdash;and had gone on dreaming
for long, long days, till even the dream had
slowly and sadly faded away? For some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>times
it does happen like that. Lynborough
meant nothing&mdash;but no possible effort
(supposing he made it) could enable him to
look as if he meant nothing. One thing at
least he did mean&mdash;to make himself very
pleasant to Miss Gilletson.</p>

<p>Interested knave! It is impossible to avoid
that reflection. Yet let ladies in their turn
ask themselves if they are over-scrupulous
in their treatment of one man when their
affections are set upon another.</p>

<p>He showed Miss Gilletson all the family
tombs. He escorted her from the church.
Under renewed vows of secrecy he induced
her to enter Scarsmoor. Once in the gardens,
the good lady was lost. They had no such
roses at Nab Grange! Lynborough insisted
on sending an enormous bouquet to the
Vicar's wife in Miss Gilletson's name&mdash;and
Miss Gilletson grew merry as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
pictured the mystification of the Vicar's wife.
For Miss Gilletson herself he superintended
the selection of a nosegay of the choicest
blooms; they laughed again together when
she hid them in a large bag she carried&mdash;destined
for the tea and tobacco which
represented her little charities. Then&mdash;after
pausing for one private word in his
gardener's ear, which caused a boy to be
sent off post-haste to the stables&mdash;he led
her to the road, and in vain implored her
to honor his house by setting foot in it.
There the fear of the Marchesa or (it is
pleasanter to think) some revival of the
sense of youth, bred by Lynborough's deferential
courtliness, prevailed. They came
together through his lodge gates; and Miss
Gilletson's face suddenly fell.</p>

<p>"That wretched gate!" she cried. "It's
locked&mdash;and I haven't got the key."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more have I, I'm sorry to say,"
said Lynborough. He, on his part, had
forgotten nothing.</p>

<p>"It's nearly two miles round by the road&mdash;and
so hot and dusty!&mdash;Really Helena
does cut off her nose to spite her face!"
Though, in truth, it appeared rather to be
Miss Gilletson's nose the Marchesa had cut
off.</p>

<p>A commiserating gravity sat on Lord
Lynborough's attentive countenance.</p>

<p>"If I were younger, I'd climb that wall,"
declared Miss Gilletson. "As it is&mdash;well,
but for your lovely flowers, I'd better have
gone the other way after all."</p>

<p>"I don't want you to feel that," said he,
almost tenderly.</p>

<p>"I must walk!"</p>

<p>"Oh no, you needn't," said Lynborough.</p>

<p>As he spoke, there issued from the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
behind them a luxurious victoria, drawn by
two admirable horses. It came to a stand by
Lynborough, the coachman touching his
hat, the footman leaping to the ground.</p>

<p>"Just take Miss Gilletson to the Grange,
Williams. Stop a little way short of the
house. She wants to walk through the
garden."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lord."</p>

<p>"Put up the hood, Charles. The sun's
very hot for Miss Gilletson."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Nobody'll see you if you get out a hundred
yards from the door&mdash;and it's really
better than tramping the road on a day
like this. Of course, if Beach Path were
open&mdash;!" He shrugged his shoulders ever
so slightly.</p>

<p>Fear of the Marchesa struggled in Miss
Gilletson's heart with the horror of the hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and tiring walk&mdash;with the seduction of the
shady, softly rolling, speedy carriage.</p>

<p>"If I met Helena!" she whispered; and
the whisper was an admission of reciprocal
confidence.</p>

<p>"It's the chance of that against the certainty
of the tramp!"</p>

<p>"She didn't come down to breakfast this
morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, didn't she?" Lynborough made a
note for his Intelligence Department.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she isn't up yet! I&mdash;I think
I'll take the risk."</p>

<p>Lynborough assisted her into the carriage.</p>

<p>"I hope we shall meet again," he said,
with no small <i>empressement</i>.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," answered Miss Gilletson
dolefully. "You see, Helena&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; but ladies have their moods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Anyhow you won't think too hardly of me,
will you? I'm not altogether an ogre."</p>

<p>There was a pretty faint blush on Miss
Gilletson's cheek as she gave him her hand.
"An ogre! No, dear Lord Lynborough,"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"A wedge!" said Lynborough, as he
watched her drive away.</p>

<p>He was triumphant with what he had
achieved&mdash;he was full of hope for what
he had planned. If he reckoned right, the
loyalty of the ladies at Nab Grange to the
mistress thereof was tottering, if it had not
fallen. His relations with the men awaited
the result of the cricket match. Yet neither
his triumph nor his hope could in the nature
of the case exist without an intermixture
of remorse. He hurt&mdash;or tried to hurt&mdash;what
he would please&mdash;and hoped to please.
His mood was mixed, and his smile not al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>together
mirthful as he stood looking at the
fast-receding carriage.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, for the first time, he saw
his enemy. Distantly&mdash;afar off! Yet without
a doubt it was she. As he turned and cast
his eyes over the forbidden path&mdash;the path
whose seclusion he had violated, bold in his
right&mdash;a white figure came to the sunk
fence and stood there, looking not toward
where he stood, but up to his castle on the
hill. Lynborough edged near to the barricaded
gate&mdash;a new padlock and new
<i>chevaux-de-frise</i> of prickly branches guarded
it. The latter, high as his head, screened him
completely; he peered through the interstices
in absolute security.</p>

<p>The white figure stood on the little bridge
which led over the sunk fence into the meadow.
He could see neither feature nor color;
only the slender shape caught and chained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
his eye. Tall she was, and slender, as his
mocking forecast had prophesied. More than
that he could not see.</p>

<p>Well, he did see one more thing. This
beautiful shape, after a few minutes of what
must be presumed to be meditation, raised
its arm and shook its fist with decision at
Scarsmoor Castle; then it turned and walked
straight back to the Grange.</p>

<p>There was no sort of possibility of mistaking
the nature or the meaning of the gesture.</p>

<p>It had the result of stifling Lynborough's
softer mood, of reviving his pugnacity.
"She must do more than that, if she's to
win!" said he.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE MARCHESA MOVES</h3>


<p>After her demonstration against Scarsmoor
Castle, the Marchesa went in to lunch. But
there were objects of her wrath nearer home
also. She received Norah's salute&mdash;they
had not met before, that morning&mdash;with
icy coldness.</p>

<p>"I'm better, thank you," she said, "but
you must be feeling tired&mdash;having been up so
very early in the morning! And you&mdash;Violet&mdash;have
you been over to Scarsmoor again?"</p>

<p>Violet had heard from Norah all about the
latter's morning adventure. They exchanged
uneasy glances. Yet they were prepared to
back one another up. The men looked more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
frightened; men are frightened when women
quarrel.</p>

<p>"One of you," continued the Marchesa
accusingly, "pursues Lord Lynborough to
his own threshold&mdash;the other flirts with
him in my own meadow! Rather peculiar
signs of friendship for me under the present
circumstances&mdash;don't you think so, Colonel
Wenman?"</p>

<p>The Colonel thought so&mdash;though he
would have greatly preferred to be at liberty
to entertain&mdash;or at least to express&mdash;no
opinion on so thorny a point.</p>

<p>"Flirt with him? What do you mean?"
But Norah's protest lacked the ring of honest
indignation.</p>

<p>"Kissing one's hand to a mere stranger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know that? You were in
bed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Carlotta saw you from her window.
You don't deny it?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Norah, perceiving
the uselessness of such a course. "In fact, I
glory in it. I had a splendid time with Lord
Lynborough. Oh, I did try to keep him out
for you&mdash;but he jumped over my head."</p>

<p>Sensation among the gentlemen! Increased
scorn on the Marchesa's face!</p>

<p>"And when I got John Goodenough to
help me, he just laid John down on the grass
as&mdash;as I lay that spoon on the table! He's
splendid, Helena!"</p>

<p>"He seems a good sort of chap," said
Irons thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The Marchesa looked at Wenman.</p>

<p>"Nothing to be said for the fellow, nothing
at all," declared the Colonel hastily.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Colonel Wenman. I'm glad
I have one friend left anyhow. Oh, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
you, Mr. Stillford, of course. Oh, and you,
dear old Jennie, of course. You wouldn't
forsake me, would you?"</p>

<p>The tone of affection was calculated to
gratify Miss Gilletson. But against it had
to be set the curious and amused gaze of
Norah and Violet. Seen by these two ladies
in the act of descending from a stylish (and
coroneted) victoria in the drive of Nab
Grange, Miss Gilletson had, pardonably
perhaps, broken down rather severely in
cross-examination. She had been so very
proud of the roses&mdash;so very full of Lord
Lynborough's graces! She was conscious
now that the pair held her in their hands
and were demanding courage from her.</p>

<p>"Forsake you, dearest Helena? Of course
not! There's no question of that with any
of us."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;there is&mdash;with those of you who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
make friends with that wretch at Scarsmoor!"</p>

<p>"Really, Helena, you shouldn't be so&mdash;so
vehement. I'm not sure it's ladylike. It's
absurd to call Lord Lynborough a wretch."
The pale faint flush again adorned her fading
cheeks. "I never met a man more thoroughly
a gentleman."</p>

<p>"You never met&mdash;" began the Marchesa
in petrified tones. "Then you have met&mdash;?"
Again her words died away.</p>

<p>Miss Gilletson took her courage in both
hands.</p>

<p>"Circumstances threw us together. I
behaved as a lady does under such circumstances,
Helena. And Lord Lynborough was,
under the circumstances, most charming,
courteous, and considerate." She gathered
more courage as she proceeded. "And really
it's highly inconvenient having that gate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
locked, Helena. I had to come all the way
round by the road."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry if you find yourself fatigued,"
said the Marchesa with formal civility.</p>

<p>"I'm not fatigued, thank you, Helena. I
should have been terribly&mdash;but for Lord
Lynborough's kindness in sending me home
in his carriage."</p>

<p>A pause followed. Then Norah and Violet
began to giggle.</p>

<p>"It was so funny this morning!" said
Norah&mdash;and boldly launched on a full
story of her adventure. She held the attention
of the table. The Marchesa sat in
gloomy silence. Violet chimed in with more
reminiscences of her visit to Scarsmoor;
Miss Gilletson contributed new items, including
that matter of the roses. Norah
ended triumphantly with a eulogy on Lynborough's
extraordinary physical powers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Captain Irons listened with concealed interest.
Even Colonel Wenman ventured to
opine that the enemy was worth fighting.
Stillford imitated his hostess's silence, but
he was watching her closely. Would her
courage&mdash;or her obstinacy&mdash;break down
under these assaults, this lukewarmness,
these desertions? In his heart, fearful of
that lawsuit, he hoped so.</p>

<p>"I shall prosecute him for assaulting
Goodenough," the Marchesa announced.</p>

<p>"Goodenough touched him first!" cried
Norah.</p>

<p>"That doesn't matter, since I'm in the
right. He had no business to be there. That's
the law, isn't it, Mr. Stillford? Will he be
sent to prison or only heavily fined?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;I'm rather afraid&mdash;neither,
Marchesa. You see, he'll plead his
right, and the Bench would refer us to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
civil remedy and dismiss the summons. At
least that's my opinion."</p>

<p>"Of course that's right," pronounced
Norah in an authoritative tone.</p>

<p>"If that's the English law," observed
the Marchesa, rising from the table, "I
greatly regret that I ever settled in England."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do this afternoon,
Helena? Going to play tennis&mdash;or croquet?"</p>

<p>"I'm going for a walk, thank you, Violet."
She paused for a moment and then added,
"By myself."</p>

<p>"Oh, mayn't I have the privilege&mdash;?"
began the Colonel.</p>

<p>"Not to-day, thank you, Colonel Wenman.
I&mdash;I have a great deal to think about. We
shall meet again at tea&mdash;unless you're
all going to tea at Scarsmoor Castle!" With
this Parthian shot she left them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>She had indeed much to think of&mdash;and
her reflections were not cast in a cheerful
mold. She had underrated her enemy. It
had seemed sufficient to lock the gate and
to forbid Lynborough's entry. These easy
measures had appeared to leave him no
resource save blank violence: in that confidence
she had sat still and done nothing.
He had been at work&mdash;not by blank violence,
but by cunning devices and subtle
machinations. He had made a base use of
his personal fascinations, of his athletic
gifts, even of his lordly domain, his garden
of roses, and his carriage. She perceived his
strategy; she saw now how he had driven
in his wedges. Her ladies had already gone
over to his side; even her men were shaken.
Stillford had always been lukewarm; Irons
was fluttering round Lynborough's flame;
Wenman might still be hers&mdash;but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
isolation mitigated only by Colonel Wenman
seemed an isolation not mitigated in the
least. When she had looked forward to a
fight, it had not been to such a fight as this.
An enthusiastic, hilarious, united Nab
Grange was to have hurled laughing defiance
at Scarsmoor Castle. Now more than
half Nab Grange laughed&mdash;but its laughter
was not at the Castle; its laughter, its pitying
amusement, was directed at her; Lynborough's
triumphant campaign drew all admiration.
He had told Stillford that he would
harry her; he was harrying her to his heart's
content&mdash;and to a very soreness in hers.</p>

<p>For the path&mdash;hateful Beach Path which
her feet at this moment trod&mdash;became now
no more than an occasion for battle, a symbol
of strife. The greater issue stood out. It
was that this man had peremptorily challenged
her to a fight&mdash;and was beating her!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
And he won his victory, not by male violence
in spite of male stupidity, but by just the
arts and the cunning which should have
been her own weapons. To her he left the
blunt, the inept, the stupid and violent
methods. He chose the more refined, and
wielded them like a master. It was a position
to which the Marchesa's experience had not
accustomed her&mdash;one to which her spirit
was by no means attuned.</p>

<p>What was his end&mdash;that end whose approach
seemed even now clearly indicated?
It was to convict her at once of cowardice
and of pig-headedness, to exhibit her as
afraid to bring him to book by law, and yet
too churlish to cede him his rights. He would
get all her friends to think that about her.
Then she would be left alone&mdash;to fight a
lost battle all alone.</p>

<p>Was he right in his charge? Did it truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
describe her conduct? For any truth there
might be in it, she declared that he was
himself to blame. He had forced the fight on
her by his audacious demand for instant
surrender; he had given her no fair time
for consideration, no opportunity for a dignified
retreat. He had offered her no choice
save between ignominy and defiance. If she
chose defiance, his rather than hers was the
blame.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;across these dismal broodings&mdash;there
shot a new idea. <i>Fas est et
ab hoste doceri</i>; she did not put it in Latin,
but it came to the same thing&mdash;Couldn't
she pay Lynborough back in his own coin?
She had her resources&mdash;perhaps she had
been letting them lie idle! Lord Lynborough
did not live alone at Scarsmoor. If there were
women open to his wiles at the Grange,
were there no men open to hers at Scars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>moor?
The idea was illuminating; she accorded
it place in her thoughts.</p>

<p>She was just by the gate. She took out her
key, opened the padlock, closed the gate
behind her, but did not lock it, walked on
to the road, and surveyed the territory of
Scarsmoor.</p>

<p>Fate helps those who help themselves:
her new courage of brain and heart had its
reward. She had not been there above a
minute when Roger Wilbraham came out
from the Scarsmoor gates.</p>

<p>Lynborough had, he considered, done
enough for one day. He was awaiting the
results of to-morrow's manoeuvers anent
the cricket match. But he amused himself
after lunch by proffering to Roger a wager
that he would not succeed in traversing
Beach Path from end to end, and back again,
alone, by his own unassisted efforts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
without being driven to ignominious flight.
Without a moment's hesitation Roger accepted.
"I shall just wait till the coast's
clear," he said.</p>

<p>"Ah, but they'll see you from the windows!
They will be on the lookout," Lynborough
retorted.</p>

<p>The Marchesa had strolled a little way
down the road. She was walking back toward
the gate when Roger first came in
sight. He did not see her until after he had
reached the gate. There he stood a moment,
considering at what point to attack it&mdash;for
the barricade was formidable. He came to the
same conclusion as Lynborough had reached
earlier in the day. "Oh, I'll jump the wall,"
he said.</p>

<p>"The gate isn't locked," remarked a
charming voice just behind him.</p>

<p>He turned round with a start and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>&mdash;he
had no doubt whom she was. The Marchesa's
tall slender figure stood before him&mdash;all
in white, crowned by a large, yet simple,
white hat; her pale olive cheeks were tinged
with underlying red (the flush of which
Lynborough had dreamed!); her dark eyes
rested on the young man with a kindly
languid interest; her very red lips showed
no smile, yet seemed to have one in ready
ambush. Roger was overcome; he blushed
and stood silent before the vision.</p>

<p>"I expect you're going to bathe? Of course
this is the shortest way, and I shall be so
glad if you'll use it. I'm going to the Grange
myself, so I can put you on your way."</p>

<p>Roger was honest. "I&mdash;I'm staying at
the Castle."</p>

<p>"I'll tell somebody to be on the lookout
and open the gate for you when you come
back," said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>If Norah was no match for Lynborough,
Roger was none for the Marchesa's practised
art.</p>

<p>"You're&mdash;you're awfully kind. I&mdash;I
shall be delighted, of course."</p>

<p>The Marchesa passed through the gate.
Roger followed. She handed him the key.</p>

<p>"Will you please lock the padlock? It's
not&mdash;safe&mdash;to leave the gate open."</p>

<p>Her smile had come into the open&mdash;it
was on the red lips now! For all his agitation
Roger was not blind to its meaning.
His hand was to lock the gate against his
friend and chief! But the smile and the eyes
commanded. He obeyed.</p>

<p>It was the first really satisfactory moment
which the contest had brought to the Marchesa&mdash;some
small instalment of consolation
for the treason of her friends.</p>

<p>Roger had been honestly in love once with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
a guileless maiden&mdash;who had promptly
and quite unguilefully refused him; his experience
did not at all fit him to cope with
the Marchesa. She, of course, was merciless:
was he not of the hated house? As an individual,
however, he appeared to be comely
and agreeable.</p>

<p>They walked on side by side&mdash;not very
quickly. The Marchesa's eyes were now
downcast. Roger was able to steal a glance
at her profile; he could compare it to nothing
less than a Roman Empress on an ancient
silver coin.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've been taught to think
me a very rude and unneighborly person,
haven't you, Mr. Wilbraham? At least I
suppose you're Mr. Wilbraham? You don't
look old enough to be that learned Mr.
Stabb the Vicar told me about. Though he
said Mr. Stabb was absolutely delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>&mdash;how
I should love to know him, if only&mdash;!"
She broke off, sighing deeply.</p>

<p>"Yes, my name's Wilbraham. I'm Lynborough's
secretary. But&mdash;er&mdash;I don't
think anything of that sort about you.
And&mdash;and I've never heard Lynborough
say anything&mdash;er&mdash;unkind."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord Lynborough!" She gave a
charming little shrug, accompanied with
what Roger, from his novel-reading, conceived
to be a <i>moue</i>.</p>

<p>"Of course I&mdash;I know that you&mdash;you
think you're right," he stammered.</p>

<p>She stopped on the path. "Yes, I do
think I'm right, Mr. Wilbraham. But that's
not it. If it were merely a question of right,
it would be unneighborly to insist. I'm not
hurt by Lord Lynborough's using this path.
But I'm hurt by Lord Lynborough's discourtesy.
In my country women are treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
with respect&mdash;even sometimes (she gave a
bitter little laugh) with deference. That
doesn't seem to occur to Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"Well, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't let you say a word against
him, whatever you may be obliged to think.
In your position&mdash;as his friend&mdash;that
would be disloyal; and the one thing I dislike
is disloyalty. Only I was anxious"&mdash;she
turned and faced him&mdash;"that you should understand
my position&mdash;and that Mr. Stabb
should too. I shall be very glad if you and Mr.
Stabb will use the path whenever you like. If
the gate's locked you can manage the wall!"</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm most awfully obliged to you&mdash;er&mdash;Marchesa&mdash;but
you see&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more need be said about that, Mr.
Wilbraham. You're heartily welcome. Lord
Lynborough would have been heartily welcome
too, if he would have approached me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
properly. I was open to discussion. I received
orders. I don't take orders&mdash;not
even from Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>She looked splendid&mdash;so Roger thought.
The underlying red dyed the olive to a
brighter hue; her eyes were very proud; the
red lips shut decisively. Just like a Roman
Empress! Then her face underwent a
rapid transformation; the lips parted, the
eyes laughed, the cheeks faded to hues less
stormy, yet not less beautiful. (These are
recorded as Mr. Wilbraham's impressions.)
Lightly she laid the tips of her fingers on his
arm for just a moment.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;don't let's talk any more about
disagreeable things," she said. "It's too
beautiful an afternoon. Can you spare just
five minutes? The strawberries are splendid!
I want some&mdash;and it's so hot to pick them
for one's self!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Roger paused, twisting the towel round
his neck.</p>

<p>"Only five minutes!" pleaded&mdash;yes,
pleaded&mdash;the beautiful Marchesa. "Then
you can go and have your swim in peace."</p>

<p>It was a question whether poor Roger was
to do anything more in peace that day&mdash;but
he went and picked the strawberries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_Nine" id="Chapter_Nine"></a><i>Chapter Nine</i></h2>

<h3>LYNBOROUGH DROPS A CATCH</h3>


<p>"Something has happened!" (So Lynborough
records the same evening.) "I
don't know precisely what&mdash;but I think
that the enemy is at last in motion. I'm glad.
I was being too successful. I had begun to
laugh at her&mdash;and that only. I prefer the
admixture of another element of emotion.
All that ostensibly appears is that I have
lost five shillings to Roger. 'You did it?' I
asked. 'Certainly,' said Roger. 'I went at
my ease and came back at my ease, and&mdash;'
I interrupted, 'Nobody stopped you?'
'Nobody made any objection,' said Roger.
'You took your time,' says I. 'You were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
away three hours!' 'The water was very
pleasant this afternoon,' says Roger. Hum!
I hand over my two half-crowns, which
Roger pockets with a most peculiar sort
of smile. There that incident appears to
end&mdash;with a comment from me that the
Marchesa's garrison is not very alert. Another
smile&mdash;not less peculiar&mdash;from
Roger! <i>Hum!</i></p>

<p>"Then Cromlech! I trust Cromlech as
myself&mdash;that is, as far as I can see him.
He has no secrets from me&mdash;that I know of;
I have none from him&mdash;which would be
at all likely to interest him. Yet, soon after
Roger's return, Cromlech goes out! And
they had been alone together for some minutes,
as I happen to have observed. Cromlech
is away an hour and a half! If I were not
a man of honor, I would have trained the
telescope on to him. I refrained. Where was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Cromlech? At the church, he told me. I
accept his word&mdash;but the church has had a
curious effect upon him. Sometimes he is silent,
sulky, reflective, embarrassed&mdash;constantly
rubbing the place where his hair ought to be&mdash;not
altogether too civil to me either.
Anon, sits with a fat happy smile on his face!
Has he found a new tomb? No; he'd tell
me about a new tomb. What has happened
to Cromlech?</p>

<p>"At first sight Violet&mdash;the insinuating
one&mdash;would account for the phenomena.
Or Norah's eyes and lashes? Yet I hesitate.
Woman, of course, it is, with both of them.
Violet might make men pleased with themselves;
Norah could make them merry and
happy. Yet these two are not so much pleased
with themselves&mdash;rather they are pleased
with events; they are not merry&mdash;they are
thoughtful. And I think they are resentful. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
believe the hostile squadron has weighed anchor.
In these great results, achieved so
quickly, demanding on my part such an
effort in reply, I see the Marchesa's touch!
I have my own opinion as to what has
happened to Roger and to Cromlech. Well,
we shall see&mdash;to-morrow is the cricket
match!"</p>

<p>"<i>Later.</i> I had closed this record; I was
preparing to go to bed (wishing to bathe
early to-morrow) when I found that I had
forgotten to bring up my book. Coltson
had gone to bed&mdash;or out&mdash;anyhow, away.
I went down myself. The library door stood
ajar; I had on my slippers; a light burned
still; Cromlech and Roger were up. As I
approached&mdash;with an involuntary noiselessness
(I really couldn't be expected to
think of coughing, in my own house and
with no ladies about)&mdash;I overheard this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
remarkable, most significant, most important
conversation:</p>

<p>"<i>Cromlech</i>: 'On my soul, there were tears
in her eyes!'</p>

<p>"<i>Roger</i>: 'Stabb, can we as gentlemen&mdash;?'</p>

<p>"Then, as I presume, the shuffle of my
slippers became audible. I went in; both
drank whisky-and-soda in a hurried fashion.
I took my book from the table. Naught said
I. Their confusion was obvious. I cast on
them one of my looks; Roger blushed, Stabb
shuffled his feet. I left them.</p>

<p>"'Tears in her eyes!' 'Can we as gentlemen?'</p>

<p>"The Marchesa moves slowly, but she
moves in force!"</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to pursue the diary
further; for his lordship&mdash;forgetful apparently
of the borne of bed, to which he had
originally destined himself&mdash;launches into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a variety of speculations as to the Nature of
Love. Among other questions, he puts to
himself the following concerning Love:
(1) Is it Inevitable? (2) Is it Agreeable?
(3) Is it Universal? (4) Is it Wise? (5) Is it
Remunerative? (6) Is it Momentary? (7)
Is it Sempiternal? (8) Is it Voluntary? (9)
Is it Conditioned? (10) Is it Remediable?
(11) Is it Religious? (There's a note here&mdash;"Consult
Cromlech")&mdash;(12) May it be
expected to survive the Advance of Civilization?
(13) Why does it exist at all? (14) Is
it Ridiculous?</p>

<p>It is not to be inferred that Lord Lynborough
answers these questions. He is,
like a wise man, content to propound them.
If, however, he had answered them, it might
have been worth while to transcribe the diary.</p>

<p>"Can we as gentlemen&mdash;?"&mdash;Roger
had put the question. It waited unanswered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
till Lynborough had taken his book and
returned to record its utterance&mdash;together
with the speculations to which that utterance
gave rise. Stabb weighed it carefully, rubbing
his bald head, according to the habit which
his friend had animadverted upon.</p>

<p>"If such a glorious creature&mdash;" cried
Roger.</p>

<p>"If a thoroughly intelligent and most
sympathetic woman&mdash;" said Stabb.</p>

<p>"Thinks that she has a right, why, she
probably has one!"</p>

<p>"At any rate her view is entitled to respect&mdash;to
a courteous hearing."</p>

<p>"Lynborough does appear to have been
a shade&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ambrose is a spoiled child, bless him!
She took a wonderful interest in my brasses.
I don't know what brought her to the
church."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"She waited herself to let me through
that beastly gate again!"</p>

<p>"She drove me round herself to our gates.
Wouldn't come through Scarsmoor!"</p>

<p>They both sighed. They both thought
of telling the other something&mdash;but on
second thoughts refrained.</p>

<p>"I suppose we'd better go to bed. Shall
you bathe to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"With Ambrose? No, I sha'n't, Wilbraham."</p>

<p>"No more shall I. Good-night, Stabb.
You'll&mdash;think it over?"</p>

<p>Stabb grunted inarticulately. Roger drew
the blind aside for a moment, looked down
on Nab Grange, saw a light in one window&mdash;and
went to bed. The window was, in
objective fact (if there be such a thing),
Colonel Wenman's. No matter. There nothing
is but thinking makes it so. The Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was sitting up, writing a persuasive letter
to his tailor. He served emotions that he did
not feel; it is a not uncommon lot.</p>

<p>Lynborough's passing and repassing to
and from his bathing were uninterrupted
next morning. Nab Grange seemed wrapped
in slumber; only Goodenough saw him,
and Goodenough did not think it advisable
to interrupt his ordinary avocations. But
an air of constraint&mdash;even of mystery&mdash;marked
both Stabb and Roger at breakfast.
The cricket match was naturally the topic&mdash;though
Stabb declared that he took little
interest in it and should probably not be
there.</p>

<p>"There'll be some lunch, I suppose,"
said Lynborough carelessly. "You'd better
have lunch there&mdash;it'd be dull for you all
by yourself here, Cromlech."</p>

<p>After apparent consideration Stabb con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>ceded
that he might take luncheon on the
cricket ground; Roger, as a member of the
Fillby team, would, of course, do likewise.</p>

<p>The game was played in a large field,
pleasantly surrounded by a belt of trees, and
lying behind the Lynborough Arms. Besides
Roger and Lynborough, Stillford and
Irons represented Fillby. Easthorpe Polytechnic
came in full force, save for an umpire.
Colonel Wenman, who had walked
up with his friends, was pressed into this
honorable and responsible service, landlord
Dawson officiating at the other end. Lynborough's
second gardener, a noted fast
bowler, was Fillby's captain; Easthorpe was
under the command of a curate who had
played several times for his University,
although he had not actually achieved his
"blue." Easthorpe won the toss and took
first innings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>The second gardener, aware of his employer's
turn of speed, sent Lord Lynborough
to field "in the country." That gentleman
was well content; few balls came his
way and he was at leisure to contemplate
the exterior of the luncheon tent&mdash;he had
already inspected the interior thereof with
sedulous care and high contentment&mdash;and
to speculate on the probable happenings of
the luncheon hour. So engrossed was he
that only a rapturous cheer, which rang out
from the field and the spectators, apprised
him of the fact that the second gardener had
yorked the redoubtable curate with the
first ball of his second over! Young Woodwell
came in; he was known as a mighty
hitter; Lynborough was signaled to take his
position yet deeper in the field. Young
Woodwell immediately got to business&mdash;but
he kept the ball low. Lynborough had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
however, the satisfaction of saving several
"boundaries." Roger, keeping wicket, observed
his chief's exertions with some satisfaction.
Other wickets fell rapidly&mdash;but
young Woodwell's score rapidly mounted
up. If he could stay in, they would make
a hundred&mdash;and Fillby looked with just
apprehension on a score like that. The
second gardener, who had given himself a
brief rest, took the ball again with an air
of determination.</p>

<p>"Peters doesn't seem to remember that I
also bowl," reflected Lord Lynborough.</p>

<p>The next moment he was glad of this
omission. Young Woodwell was playing
for safety now&mdash;his fifty loomed ahead!
Lynborough had time for a glance round.
He saw Stabb saunter on to the field; then&mdash;just
behind where he stood when the second
gardener was bowling from the Lynborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
Arms end of the field&mdash;a wagonette drove
up. Four ladies descended. A bench was
placed at their disposal, and the two menservants
at once began to make preparations
for lunch, aided therein by the ostler from
the Lynborough Arms, who rigged up a
table on trestles under a spreading tree.</p>

<p>Lord Lynborough's reputation as a sportsman
inevitably suffers from this portion of
the narrative. Yet extenuating circumstances
may fairly be pleaded. He was deeply interested
in the four ladies who sat behind
him on the bench; he was vitally concerned
in the question of the lunch. As he walked
back, between the overs, to his position, he
could see that places were being set for some
half-dozen people. Would there be half-a-dozen
there? As he stood, watching, or
trying to watch, young Woodwell's dangerous
bat, he overheard fragments of conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>sation
wafted from the bench. The ladies
were too far from him to allow of their
faces being clearly seen, but it was not hard
to recognize their figures.</p>

<p>The last man in had joined young Woodwell.
That hero's score was forty-eight, the
total ninety-three. The second gardener was
tempting the Easthorpe champion with an
occasional slow ball; up to now young
Woodwell had declined to hit at these deceivers.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lynborough heard the ladies'
voices quite plainly. They&mdash;or some of them&mdash;had
left the bench and come nearer to
the boundary. Irresistibly drawn by curiosity,
for an instant he turned his head. At
the same instant the second gardener delivered
a slow ball&mdash;a specious ball. This
time young Woodwell fell into the snare.
He jumped out and opened his shoulders to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
it. He hit it&mdash;but he hit it into the air. It
soared over the bowler's head and came
traveling through high heaven toward
Lord Lynborough.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried the second gardener.
Lynborough's head spun round again&mdash;but
his nerves were shaken. His eyes seemed
rather in the back of his head, trying to see
the Marchesa's face, than fixed on the ball
that was coming toward him. He was in no
mood for bringing off a safe catch!</p>

<p>Silence reigned, the ball began to drop.
Lynborough had an instant to wait for it.
He tried to think of the ball and the ball only.</p>

<p>It fell&mdash;it fell into his hands; he caught it&mdash;fumbled
it&mdash;caught it&mdash;fumbled it
again&mdash;and at last dropped it on the grass!
"Oh!" went in a long-drawn expostulation
round the field; and Lynborough heard a
voice say plainly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is that stupid clumsy man?" The
voice was the Marchesa's.</p>

<p>He wheeled round sharply&mdash;but her
back was turned. He had not seen her face
after all!</p>

<p>"Over!" was called. Lynborough apologized
abjectly to the second gardener.</p>

<p>"The sun was in my eyes, Peters, and
dazzled me," he pleaded.</p>

<p>"Looks to <i>me</i> as if the sun was shining the
other way, my lord," said Peters dryly. And
so, in physical fact, it was.</p>

<p>In Peters' next over Lynborough atoned&mdash;for
young Woodwell had got his fifty
and grown reckless. A one-handed catch,
wide on his left side, made the welkin ring
with applause. The luncheon bell rang too&mdash;for
the innings was finished. Score 101.
Last man out 52. Jim (office-boy at Polytechnic)
not out 0. Young Woodwell received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
a merited ovation&mdash;and Lord Lynborough
hurried to the luncheon tent. The Marchesa,
with an exceedingly dignified mien,
repaired to her table under the spreading
oak.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson had done himself more than
justice; the repast was magnificent. When
Stillford and Irons saw it, they became more
sure than ever what their duty was, more
convinced still that the Marchesa would
understand. Colonel Wenman became less
sure what his duty was&mdash;previously it had
appeared to him that it was to lunch with
the Marchesa. But the Marchesa had
spoken of a few sandwiches and perhaps a
bottle of claret. Stillford told him that, as
umpire, he ought to lunch with the teams.
Irons declared it would look "deuced standoffish"
if he didn't. Lynborough, who appeared
to act as deputy-landlord to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Dawson, pressed him into a chair with a
friendly hand.</p>

<p>"Well, she'll have the ladies with her,
won't she?" said the Colonel, his last
scruple vanishing before a large jug of hock-cup,
artfully iced. The Nab Grange contingent
fell to.</p>

<p>Just then&mdash;when they were irrevocably
committed to this feast&mdash;the flap of the
tent was drawn back, and Lady Norah's
face appeared. Behind her stood Violet and
Miss Gilletson. Lynborough ran forward
to meet them.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Lord Lynborough," said
Norah. "The Marchesa was so kind, she
told us to do just as we liked, and we thought
it would be such fun to lunch with the
cricketers."</p>

<p>"The cricketers are immensely honored.
Let me introduce you to our captain, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Peters. You must sit by him, you know.
And, Miss Dufaure, will you sit by Mr.
Jeffreys?&mdash;he's their captain&mdash;Miss Dufaure&mdash;Mr. Jeffreys.
You, Miss Gilletson,
must sit between Mr. Dawson and me.
Now we're right&mdash;What, Colonel Wenman?&mdash;What's
the matter?"</p>

<p>Wenman had risen from his place. "The&mdash;the
Marchesa!" he said. "We&mdash;we
can't leave her to lunch alone!"</p>

<p>Lady Norah broke in again. "Oh, Helena
expressly said that she didn't expect the
gentlemen. She knows what the custom is,
you see."</p>

<p>The Marchesa had, no doubt, made all
these speeches. It may, however, be doubted
whether Norah reproduced exactly the manner,
and the spirit, in which she made
them. But the iced hock-cup settled the
Colonel. With a relieved sigh he resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
his place. The business of the moment went
on briskly for a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawson rose, glass in hand. "Ladies
and gentlemen," said he, "I'm no hand at a
speech, but I give you the health of our kind
neighbor and good host to-day&mdash;Lord
Lynborough. Here's to his lordship!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't know he was giving the
lunch!" whispered Colonel Wenman.</p>

<p>"Is it his lunch?" said Irons, nudging
Stillford.</p>

<p>Stillford laughed. "It looks like it. And
we can hardly throw him over the hedge
after this!"</p>

<p>"Well, he seems to be a jolly good chap,"
said Captain Irons.</p>

<p>Lynborough bowed his acknowledgments,
and flirted with Miss Gilletson; his face wore
a contented smile. Here they all were&mdash;and
the Marchesa lunched alone on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
side of the field! Here indeed was a new
wedge! Here was the isolation at which his
diabolical schemes had aimed. He had captured
Nab Grange! Bag and baggage they
had come over&mdash;and left their chieftainess
deserted.</p>

<p>Then suddenly&mdash;in the midst of his
triumph&mdash;in the midst too of a certain not
ungenerous commiseration which he felt
that he could extend to a defeated enemy
and to beauty in distress&mdash;he became
vaguely aware of a gap in his company.
Stabb was not there! Yet Stabb had come
upon the ground. He searched the company
again. No, Stabb was not there. Moreover&mdash;a
fact the second search revealed&mdash;Roger
Wilbraham was not there. Roger
was certainly not there; yet, whatever Stabb
might do, Roger would never miss lunch!</p>

<p>Lynborough's eyes grew thoughtful; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
pursed up his lips. Miss Gilletson noticed
that he became silent.</p>

<p>He could bear the suspense no longer.
On a pretext of looking for more bottled
beer, he rose and walked to the door of the
tent.</p>

<p>Under the spreading tree the Marchesa
lunched&mdash;not in isolation, not in gloom.
She had company&mdash;and, even as he appeared,
a merry peal of laughter was wafted
by a favoring breeze across the field of
battle. Stabb's ponderous figure, Roger
Wilbraham's highly recognizable "blazer,"
told the truth plainly.</p>

<p>Lord Lynborough was not the only expert
in the art of driving wedges!</p>

<p>"Well played, Helena!" he said under his
breath.</p>

<p>The rest of the cricket match interested
him very little. Successful beyond their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
expectations, Fillby won by five runs (Wilbraham
not out thirty-seven)&mdash;but Lynborough's
score did not swell the victorious
total. In Easthorpe's second innings&mdash;which
could not affect the result&mdash;Peters
let him bowl, and he got young Woodwell's
wicket. That was a distinction; yet, looking
at the day as a whole, he had scored less
than he expected.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<h3>IN THE LAST RESORT!</h3>


<p>It will have been perceived by now that Lord
Lynborough delighted in a fight. He revelled
in being opposed; the man who withstood
him to the face gave him such pleasure as to
beget in his mind certainly gratitude, perhaps
affection, or at least a predisposition
thereto. There was nothing he liked so much
as an even battle&mdash;unless, by chance, it were
the scales seeming to incline a little against
him. Then his spirits rose highest, his courage
was most buoyant, his kindliness most sunny.</p>

<p>The benefit of this disposition accrued to
the Marchesa; for by her sudden counterattack
she had at least redressed the balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
of the campaign. He could not be sure that
she had not done more. The ladies of her
party were his&mdash;he reckoned confidently
on that; but the men he could not count
as more than neutral at the best; Wenman,
anyhow, could easily be whistled back to the
Marchesa's heel. But in his own house, he
admitted at once, she had secured for him
open hostility, for herself the warmest of
partisanship. The meaning of her lunch was
too plain to doubt. No wonder her opposition
to her own deserters had been so faint;
no wonder she had so readily, even if so
scornfully, afforded them the pretext&mdash;the
barren verbal permission&mdash;that they had
required. She had not wanted them&mdash;no,
not even the Colonel himself! She had
wanted to be alone with Roger and with
Stabb&mdash;and to complete the work of her
blandishments on those guileless, tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>hearted,
and susceptible persons. Lynborough
admired, applauded, and promised
himself considerable entertainment at dinner.</p>

<p>How was the Marchesa, in her turn,
bearing her domestic isolation, the internal
disaffection at Nab Grange? He flattered
himself that she would not be finding in it
such pleasure as his whimsical temper
reaped from the corresponding position of
affairs at Scarsmoor.</p>

<p>There he was right. At Nab Grange the
atmosphere was not cheerful. Not to want a
thing by no means implies an admission
that you do not want it; that is elementary
diplomacy. Rather do you insist that you
want it very much; if you do not get it,
there is a grievance&mdash;and a grievance is a
mighty handy article of barter. The Marchesa
knew all that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>The deserters were severely lashed. The
Marchesa had said that she did not expect
Colonel Wenman; ought she to have sent a
message to say that she was pining for him&mdash;must
that be wrung from her before he would
condescend to come? She had said that she
knew the custom with regard to lunch at
cricket matches; was that to say that she
expected it to be observed to her manifest
and public humiliation? She had told Miss
Gilletson and the girls to please themselves;
of course she wished them to do that always.
Yet it might be a wound to find that their
pleasure lay in abandoning their friend
and hostess, in consorting with her arch-enemy,
and giving him a triumph.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you say about Wilbraham
and Stabb?" cried the trampled Colonel.</p>

<p>"I say that they're gentlemen," retorted
the Marchesa. "They saw the position I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
was in&mdash;and they saved me from humiliation."</p>

<p>That was enough for the men; men are,
after all, poor fighters. It was not, however,
enough for Lady Norah Mountliffey&mdash;a
woman&mdash;and an Irishwoman to boot!</p>

<p>"Are you really asking us to believe that
you hadn't arranged it with them beforehand?"
she inquired scornfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't ask you to believe anything
I say," returned the Marchesa, dexterously
avoiding saying anything on the point
suggested.</p>

<p>"The truth is, you're being very absurd,
Helena," Norah pursued. "If you've got a
right, go to law with Lord Lynborough and
make him respect it. If you haven't got a
right, why go on making yourself ridiculous
and all the rest of us very uncomfortable?"</p>

<p>It was obvious that the Marchesa might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
reply that any guest of hers who felt himself
or herself uncomfortable at Nab Grange
had, in his or her own hand, the easy remedy.
She did not do that. She did a thing more
disconcerting still. Though the mutton had
only just been put on the table, she pushed
back her chair, rose to her feet, and fled from
the room very hastily.</p>

<p>Miss Gilletson sprang up. But Norah was
beforehand with her.</p>

<p>"No! I said it. I'm the one to go. Who
could think she'd take it like that?" Norah's
own blue eyes were less bright than usual as
she hurried after her wounded friend. The
rest ate on in dreary conscience-stricken
silence. At last Stillford spoke.</p>

<p>"Don't urge her to go to law," he said.
"I'm pretty sure she'd be beaten."</p>

<p>"Then she ought to give in&mdash;and apologize
to Lord Lynborough," said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Gilletson decisively. "That would be right&mdash;and,
I will add, Christian."</p>

<p>"Humble Pie ain't very good eating,"
commented Captain Irons.</p>

<p>Neither the Marchesa nor Norah came
back. The meal wended along its slow and
melancholy course to a mirthless weary
conclusion. Colonel Wenman began to look
on the repose of bachelorhood with a kinder
eye, on its loneliness with a more tolerant
disposition. He went so far as to remember
that, if the worst came to the worst, he had
another invitation for the following week.</p>

<p>The Spirit of Discord (The tragic atmosphere
now gathering justifies these figures
of speech&mdash;the chronicler must rise
to the occasion of a heroine in tears), having
wrought her fell work at Nab Grange, now
winged her way to the towers of Scarsmoor
Castle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinner had passed off quite as Lynborough
anticipated; he had enjoyed himself
exceedingly. Whenever the temporary absence
of the servants allowed, he had rallied
his friends on their susceptibility to beauty,
on their readiness to fail him under its lures,
on their clumsy attempts at concealment
of their growing intimacy, and their confidential
relations, with the fascinating mistress
of Nab Grange. He too had been told
to take his case into the Courts or to drop
his claim&mdash;and had laughed triumphantly
at the advice. He had laughed when Stabb
said that he really could not pursue his work
in the midst of such distractions, that his
mind was too perturbed for scientific thought.
He had laughed lightly and good-humoredly
even when (as they were left alone over
coffee) Roger Wilbraham, going suddenly
a little white, said he thought that persecut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ing
a lady was no fit amusement for a gentleman.
Lynborough did not suppose that the
Marchesa&mdash;with the battle of the day at
least drawn, if not decided in her favor&mdash;could
be regarded as the subject of persecution&mdash;and
he did recognize that young
fellows, under certain spells, spoke hotly
and were not to be held to serious account.
He was smiling still when, with a forced
remark about the heat, the pair went out
together to smoke on the terrace. He had
some letters to read, and for the moment
dismissed the matter from his mind.</p>

<p>In ten minutes young Roger Wilbraham
returned; his manner was quiet now, but
his face still rather pale. He came up to the
table by which Lynborough sat.</p>

<p>"Holding the position I do in your house,
Lord Lynborough," he said, "I had no
right to use the words I used this evening at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
dinner. I apologize for them. But, on the
other hand, I have no wish to hold a position
which prevents me from using those
words when they represent what I think. I
beg you to accept my resignation, and I shall
be greatly obliged if you can arrange to relieve
me of my duties as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Lynborough heard him without interruption;
with grave impassive face, with surprise,
pity, and a secret amusement. Even
if he were right, he was so solemn over it!</p>

<p>The young man waited for no answer.
With the merest indication of a bow, he left
Lynborough alone, and passed on into the
house.</p>

<p>"Well, now!" said Lord Lynborough,
rising and lighting a cigar. "This Marchesa!
Well, now!"</p>

<p>Stabb's heavy form came lumbering in
from the terrace; he seemed to move more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
heavily than ever, as though his bulk were
even unusually inert. He plumped down into
a chair and looked up at Lynborough's
graceful figure.</p>

<p>"I meant what I said at dinner, Ambrose.
I wasn't joking, though I suppose you
thought I was. All this affair may amuse you&mdash;it
worries me. I can't settle to work. If
you'll be so kind as to send me over to Easthorpe
to-morrow, I'll be off&mdash;back to
Oxford."</p>

<p>"Cromlech, old boy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. But I&mdash;I don't want to
stay, Ambrose. I'm not&mdash;comfortable."
His great face set in a heavy, disconsolate,
wrinkled frown.</p>

<p>Lord Lynborough pursed his lips in a
momentary whistle, then put his cigar back
into his mouth, and walked out on to the
terrace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"This Marchesa!" said he again. "This
very remarkable Marchesa! Her <i>riposte</i> is
admirable. Really I venture to hope that I,
in my turn, have very seriously disturbed
her household!"</p>

<p>He walked to the edge of the terrace, and
stood there musing. Sandy Nab loomed up,
dimly the sea rose and fell, twinkled and
sank into darkness. It talked too&mdash;talked to
Lynborough with a soft, low, quiet voice; it
seemed (to his absurdly whimsical imagination)
as though some lovely woman gently
stroked his brow and whispered to him.
He liked to encourage such freaks of fancy.</p>

<p>Cromlech couldn't go. That was absurd.</p>

<p>And the young fellow? So much a gentleman!
Lynborough had liked the terms of
his apology no less than the firmness of his
protest. "It's the first time, I think, that I've
been told that I'm no gentleman," he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>flected
with amusement. But Roger had
been pale when he said it. Imaginatively
Lynborough assumed his place. "A brave
boy," he said. "And that dear old knight-errant
of a Cromlech!"</p>

<p>A space&mdash;room indeed and room enough&mdash;for
the softer emotions&mdash;so much Lynborough
was ever inclined to allow. But to
acquiesce in this state of things as final&mdash;that
was to admit defeat at the hands of the
Marchesa. It was to concede that one day
had changed the whole complexion of the
fight.</p>

<p>"Cromlech sha'n't go&mdash;the boy sha'n't
go&mdash;and I'll still use the path," he thought.
"Not that I really care about the path, you
know." He paused. "Well, yes, I do care
about it&mdash;for bathing in the morning."
He hardened his heart against the Marchesa.
She chose to fight; the fortune of war must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
be hers. He turned his eyes down to Nab
Grange. Lights burned there&mdash;were her
guests demanding to be sent to Easthorpe?
Why, no! As he looked, Lynborough came
to the conclusion that she had reduced them
all to order&mdash;that they would be whipped
back to heel&mdash;that his manoeuvers (and
his lunch!) had probably been wasted.
He was beaten then?</p>

<p>He scorned the conclusion. But if he were
not&mdash;the result was deadlock! Then still
he was beaten; for unless Helena (he called
her that) owned his right, his right was to
him as nothing.</p>

<p>"I have made myself a champion of my
sex," he said. "Shall I be beaten?"</p>

<p>In that moment&mdash;with all the pang of
forsaking an old conviction&mdash;of disowning
that stronger tie, the loved embrace of an
ancient and perversely championed prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>&mdash;he
declared that any price must be paid
for victory.</p>

<p>"Heaven forgive me, but, sooner than be
beaten, I'll go to law with her!" he cried.</p>

<p>A face appeared from between two bushes&mdash;a
voice spoke from the edge of the terrace.</p>

<p>"I thought you might be interested to
hear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lady Norah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it's me&mdash;to hear that you've made
her cry&mdash;and very bitterly."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_Eleven" id="Chapter_Eleven"></a><i>Chapter Eleven</i></h2>

<h3>AN ARMISTICE</h3>


<p>Lord Lynborough walked down to the edge
of the terrace; Lady Norah stood half hidden
in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>"And that, I suppose, ought to end the
matter?" he asked. "I ought at once to
abandon all my pretensions and to give up
my path?"</p>

<p>"I just thought you might like to know
it," said Norah.</p>

<p>"Actually I believe I do like to know it&mdash;though
what Roger would say to me about
that I really can't imagine. You're mistaking
my character, Lady Norah. I'm not
the hero of this piece. There are several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
gentlemen from among whom you can choose
one for that effective part. Lots of candidates
for it! But I'm the villain. Consequently
you must be prepared for my receiving
your news with devilish glee."</p>

<p>"Well, you haven't seen it&mdash;and I
have."</p>

<p>"Well put!" he allowed. "How did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"Over something I said to her&mdash;something
horrid."</p>

<p>"Well, then, why am I&mdash;?" Lynborough's
hands expostulated eloquently.</p>

<p>"But you were the real reason, of course.
She thinks you've turned us all against her;
she says it's so mean to get her own friends to
turn against her."</p>

<p>"Does she now?" asked Lord Lynborough
with a thoughtful smile.</p>

<p>Norah too smiled faintly. "She says she's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
not angry with us&mdash;she's just sorry for us&mdash;because
she understands&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean she says she&mdash;she can imagine&mdash;"
Norah's smile grew a little more
pronounced. "I'm not sure she'd like me
to repeat that," said Norah. "And of course
she doesn't know I'm here at all&mdash;and you
must never tell her."</p>

<p>"Of course it's all my fault. Still, as a matter
of curiosity, what did you say to her?"</p>

<p>"I said that, if she had a good case, she
ought to go to law; and, if she hadn't, she
ought to stop making herself ridiculous and
the rest of us uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"You spoke with the general assent of the
company?"</p>

<p>"I said what I thought&mdash;yes, I think
they all agreed&mdash;but she took it&mdash;well,
in the way I've told you, you know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady Norah had, in the course of conversation,
insensibly advanced on to the terrace.
She stood there now beside Lynborough.</p>

<p>"How do you think I'm taking it?" he
asked. "Doesn't my fortitude wring applause
from you?"</p>

<p>"Taking what?"</p>

<p>"Exactly the same thing from my
friends. They tell me to go to law if I've
got a case&mdash;and at any rate to stop persecuting
a lady. And they've both given me
warning."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stabb and Mr. Wilbraham? They're
going away?"</p>

<p>"So it appears. Carry back those tidings.
Won't they dry the Marchesa's tears?"</p>

<p>Norah looked at him with a smile. "Well,
it is pretty clever of her, isn't it?" she said.
"I didn't think she'd got along as quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
as that!" Norah's voice was full of an honest
and undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"It's a little unreasonable of her to cry
under the circumstances. I'm not crying,
Lady Norah."</p>

<p>"I expect you're rather disgusted, though,
aren't you?" she suggested.</p>

<p>"I'm a little vexed at having to surrender&mdash;for
the moment&mdash;a principle which I've
held dear&mdash;at having to give my enemies an
occasion for mockery. But I must bow to
my friends' wishes. I can't lose them under
such painful circumstances. No, I must
yield, Lady Norah."</p>

<p>"You're going to give up the path?" she
cried, not sure whether she were pleased or
not with his determination.</p>

<p>"Dear me, no! I'm going to law about
it."</p>

<p>Open dismay was betrayed in her excla<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>mation:
"Oh, but what will Mr. Stillford
say to that?"</p>

<p>Lynborough laughed. Norah saw her mistake&mdash;but
she made no attempt to remedy
it. She took up another line of tactics. "It
would all come right if only you knew one
another! She's the most wonderful woman
in the world, Lord Lynborough. And
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what of me?" he asked in deceitful
gravity.</p>

<p>Norah parried, with a hasty little laugh;
"Just ask Miss Gilletson that!"</p>

<p>Lynborough smiled for a moment, then
took a turn along the terrace, and came
back to her.</p>

<p>"You must tell her that you've seen me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I couldn't do that!"</p>

<p>"You must&mdash;or here the matter ends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
and I shall be forced to go to law&mdash;ugh!
Tell her you've seen me, and that I'm open
to reason&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lord Lynborough! How can I tell her
that?"</p>

<p>"That I'm open to reason, and that I
propose an armistice. Not peace&mdash;not
yet, anyhow&mdash;but an armistice. I undertake
not to exercise my right over Beach
Path for a week from to-day, and before
the end of that week I will submit a proposal
to the Marchesa."</p>

<p>Norah saw a gleam of hope. "Very well.
I don't know what she'll say to me, but I'll
tell her that. Thank you. You'll make it a&mdash;a
pleasant proposal?"</p>

<p>"I haven't had time to consider the
proposal yet. She must inform me to-morrow
morning whether she accepts the armistice."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>He suddenly turned to the house, and
shouted up to a window above his head,
"Roger!"</p>

<p>The window was open. Roger Wilbraham
put his head out.</p>

<p>"Come down," said Lynborough. "Here's
somebody wants to see you."</p>

<p>"I never said I did, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"Let him take you home. He wants cheering
up."</p>

<p>"I like him very much. He won't really
leave you, will he?"</p>

<p>"I want you to persuade him to stay
during the armistice. I'm too proud to ask
him for myself. I shall think very little
of you, however, if he doesn't."</p>

<p>Roger appeared. Lynborough told him
that Lady Norah required an escort back to
Nab Grange; for obvious reasons he himself
was obliged to relinquish the pleasure;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Roger, he felt sure, would be charmed to
take his place. Roger was somewhat puzzled
by the turn of events, but delighted with his
mission.</p>

<p>Lynborough saw them off, went into the
library, sat down at his writing-table, and
laid paper before him. But he sat idle for
many minutes. Stabb came in, his arms full
of books.</p>

<p>"I think I left some of my stuff here,"
he said, avoiding Lynborough's eye. "I'm
just getting it together."</p>

<p>"Drop that lot too. You're not going to-morrow,
Cromlech, there's an armistice."</p>

<p>Stabb put his books down on the table,
and came up to him with outstretched hand.
Lynborough leaned back, his hands clasped
behind his head.</p>

<p>"Wait for a week," he said. "We may,
Cromlech, arrive at an accommodation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Meanwhile, for that week, I do not use the
path."</p>

<p>"I've been feeling pretty badly, Ambrose."</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't think it's safe to expose you
to the charms of beauty." He looked at his
friend in good-natured mockery. "Return
to your tombs in peace."</p>

<p>The next morning he received a communication
from Nab Grange. It ran as
follows:</p>

<p>"The Marchesa di San Servolo presents
her compliments to Lord Lynborough. The
Marchesa will be prepared to consider any
proposal put forward by Lord Lynborough,
and will place no hindrance in the way
of Lord Lynborough's using the path across
her property if it suits his convenience to
do so in the meantime."</p>

<p>"No, no!" said Lynborough, as he took a
sheet of paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lord Lynborough presents his compliments
to her Excellency the Marchesa di
San Servolo. Lord Lynborough will take an
early opportunity of submitting his proposal
to the Marchesa di San Servolo. He is
obliged for the Marchesa di San Servolo's
suggestion that he should in the meantime
use Beach Path, but cannot consent to do
so except in the exercise of his right. He
will therefore not use Beach Path during
the ensuing week."</p>

<p>"And now to pave the way for my proposal!"
he thought. For the proposal, which
had assumed a position so important in the
relations between the Marchesa and himself,
was to be of such a nature that a grave
question arose how best the way should be
paved for it.</p>

<p>The obvious course was to set his spies
to work&mdash;he could command plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
friendly help among the Nab Grange garrison&mdash;learn
the Marchesa's probable movements,
throw himself in her way, contrive
an acquaintance, make himself as pleasant
as he could, establish relations of amity, of
cordiality, even of friendship and of intimacy.
That might prepare the way, and incline
her to accept the proposal&mdash;to take the
jest&mdash;it was little more in hard reality&mdash;in
the spirit in which he put it forward,
and so to end her resistance.</p>

<p>That seemed the reasonable method&mdash;the
plain and rational line of advance.
Accordingly Lynborough disliked and distrusted
it. He saw another way&mdash;more full
of risk, more hazardous in its result, making
an even greater demand on his confidence in
himself, perhaps also on the qualities with
which his imagination credited the Marchesa.
But, on the other hand, this alternative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
was far richer in surprise, in dash&mdash;as it
seemed to him, in gallantry and a touch of
romance. It was far more medieval, more
picturesque, more in keeping with the actual
proposal itself. For the actual proposal was
one which, Lynborough flattered himself,
might well have come from a powerful yet
chivalrous baron of old days to a beautiful
queen who claimed a suzerainty which not
her power, but only her beauty, could command
or enforce.</p>

<p>"It suits my humor, and I'll do it!" he
said. "She sha'n't see me, and I won't
see her. The first she shall hear from me
shall be the proposal; the first time we
meet shall be on the twenty-fourth&mdash;or
never! A week from to-day&mdash;the twenty-fourth."</p>

<p>Now the twenty-fourth of June is, as all
the world knows (or an almanac will inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the heathen), the Feast of St. John Baptist
also called Midsummer Day.</p>

<p>So he disappeared from the view of Nab
Grange and the inhabitants thereof. He
never left his own grounds; even within
them he shunned the public road; his beloved
sea-bathing he abandoned. Nay, more,
he strictly charged Roger Wilbraham, who
often during this week of armistice went to
play golf or tennis at the Grange, to say
nothing of him; the same instructions were
laid on Stabb in case on his excursions
amidst the tombs, he should meet any
member of the Marchesa's party. So far as
the thing could be done, Lord Lynborough
obliterated himself.</p>

<p>It was playing a high stake on a risky
hand. Plainly it assumed an interest in himself
on the part of the Marchesa&mdash;an interest
so strong that absence and mystery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
(if perchance he achieved a flavor of that
attraction!) would foster and nourish it
more than presence and friendship could
conduce to its increase. She might think
nothing about him during the week! Impossible
surely&mdash;with all that had gone
before, and with his proposal to come at the
end! But if it were so&mdash;why, so he was
content. "In that case, she's a woman of no
imagination, of no taste in the picturesque,"
he said.</p>

<p>For five days the Marchesa gave no sign,
no clue to her feelings which the anxious
watchers could detect. She did indeed suffer
Colonel Wenman to depart all forlorn, most
unsuccessful and uncomforted&mdash;save by
the company of his brother-in-arms, Captain
Irons; and he was not cheerful either,
having failed notably in certain designs on
Miss Dufaure which he had been pursuing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
but whereunto more pressing matters have
not allowed of attention being given. But
Lord Lynborough she never mentioned&mdash;not
to Miss Gilletson, nor even to Norah.
She seemed to have regained her tranquillity;
her wrath at least was over; she was very
friendly to all the ladies; she was markedly
cordial to Roger Wilbraham on his visits.
But she asked him nothing of Lord Lynborough&mdash;and,
if she ever looked from the
window toward Scarsmoor Castle, none&mdash;not
even her observant maid&mdash;saw her
do it.</p>

<p>Yet Cupid was in the Grange&mdash;and very
busy. There were signs, not to be misunderstood,
that Violet had not for handsome
Stillford the scorn she had bestowed on unfortunate
Irons; and Roger, humbly and
distantly worshiping the Marchesa, deeming
her far as a queen beyond his reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
rested his eyes and solaced his spirit with the
less awe-inspiring charms, the more accessible
comradeship, of Norah Mountliffey.
Norah, as her custom was, flirted hard, yet
in her delicate fashion. Though she had not
begun to ask herself about the end yet,
she was well amused, and by no means insensible
to Roger's attractions. Only she
was preoccupied with Helena&mdash;and Lord
Lynborough. Till that riddle was solved,
she could not turn seriously to her own
affairs.</p>

<p>On the night of the twenty-second she
walked with the Marchesa in the gardens of
the Grange after dinner. Helena was very
silent; yet to Norah the silence did not seem
empty. Over against them, on its high hill,
stood Scarsmoor Castle. Roger had dined
with them, but had now gone back.</p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;and boldly&mdash;Norah spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"Do you see those three lighted windows
on the ground floor at the left end of the
house? That's his library, Helena. He sits
there in the evening. Oh, I do wonder what
he's been doing all this week!"</p>

<p>"What does it matter?" asked the Marchesa
coldly.</p>

<p>"What will he propose, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Stillford thinks he may offer to pay
me some small rent&mdash;more or less nominal&mdash;for
a perpetual right&mdash;and that, if he
does, I'd better accept."</p>

<p>"That'll be rather a dull ending to it all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stillford thinks it would be a favorable
one for me."</p>

<p>"I don't believe he means to pay you
money. It'll be something"&mdash;she paused a
moment&mdash;"something prettier than that."</p>

<p>"What has prettiness to do with it, you
child? With a right of way?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Prettiness has to do with you, though,
Helena. You don't suppose he thinks only
of that wretched path?"</p>

<p>The flush came on the Marchesa's cheek.</p>

<p>"He can hardly be said to have seen me,"
she protested.</p>

<p>"Then look your best when he does&mdash;for
I'm sure he's dreamed of you."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>Norah laughed. "Because he's a man who
takes a lot of notice of pretty women&mdash;and
he took so very little notice of me. That's
why I think so, Helena."</p>

<p>The Marchesa made no comment on the
reason given. But now&mdash;at last and undoubtedly&mdash;she
looked across at the windows
of Scarsmoor.</p>

<p>"We shall come to some business arrangement,
I suppose&mdash;and then it'll all
be over," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>All over? The trouble and the enmity&mdash;the
defiance and the fight&mdash;the excitement
and the fun? The duel would be stayed, the
combatants and their seconds would go
their various ways across the diverging
tracks of this great dissevering world.
All would be over!</p>

<p>"Then we shall have time to think of
something else!" the Marchesa added.</p>

<p>Norah smiled discreetly. Was not that
something of an admission?</p>

<p>In the library at Scarsmoor Lynborough
was inditing the proposal which he intended
to submit by his ambassadors on the morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_Twelve" id="Chapter_Twelve"></a><i>Chapter Twelve</i></h2>

<h3>AN EMBASSAGE</h3>


<p>The Marchesa's last words to Lady Norah
betrayed the state of her mind. While the
question of the path was pending, she had
been unable to think of anything else; until
it was settled she could think of nobody
except of the man in whose hands the settlement
lay. Whether Lynborough attracted
or repelled, he at least occupied and filled
her thoughts. She had come to recognize
where she stood and to face the position.
Stillford's steady pessimism left her no hope
from an invocation of the law; Lynborough's
dexterity and resource promised her no
abiding victory&mdash;at best only precarious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
temporary successes&mdash;in a private continuance
of the struggle. Worst of all&mdash;whilst
she chafed or wept, he laughed!
Certainly not to her critical friends, hardly
even to her proud self, would she confess
that she lay in her antagonist's mercy; but
the feeling of that was in her heart. If so,
he could humiliate her sorely.</p>

<p>Could he spare her? Or would he? Try
how she might, it was hard to perceive
how he could spare her without abandoning
his right. That she was sure he would not
do; all she heard of him, every sharp intuition
of him which she had, the mere glimpse
of his face as he passed by on Sandy Nab,
told her that.</p>

<p>But if he consented to pay a small&mdash;a
nominal&mdash;rent, would not her pride be
spared? No. That would be victory for him;
she would be compelled to surrender what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
she had haughtily refused, in return for
something which she did not want and
which was of no value. If that were a cloak
for her pride, the fabric of it was terribly
threadbare. Even such concession as lay in
such an offer she had wrung from him by
setting his friends against him; would that
incline him to tenderness? The offer might
leave his friends still unreconciled; what
comfort was that to her when once the fight
and the excitement of countering blow with
blow were done&mdash;when all was over? And
it was more likely that what seemed to her
cruel would seem to Stabb and Roger
reasonable&mdash;men had a terribly rigid sense
of reason in business matters. They would
return to their allegiance; her friends would
be ranged on the same side; she would be
alone&mdash;alone in humiliation and defeat.
From that fate in the end only Lynborough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
himself could rescue her; only the man who
threatened her with it could avert it. And
how could even he, save by a surrender
which he would not make? Yet if he found
out a way?</p>

<p>The thought of that possibility&mdash;though
she could devise or imagine no means by
which it might find accomplishment&mdash;carried
her toward Lynborough in a rush
of feeling. The idea&mdash;never wholly lost even
in her moments of anger and dejection&mdash;came
back&mdash;the idea that all the time he
had been playing a game, that he did not
want the wounds to be mortal, that in the
end he did not hate. If he did not hate, he
would not desire to hurt. But he desired to
win. Could he win without hurting? Then
there was a reward for him&mdash;applause for
his cleverness, and gratitude for his chivalry.</p>

<p>Stretching out her arms toward Scarsmoor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
Castle, she vowed that according to his deed
she could hate or love Lord Lynborough.
The next day was to decide that weighty
question.</p>

<p>The fateful morning arrived&mdash;the last
day of the armistice&mdash;the twenty-third.
The ladies were sitting on the lawn after
breakfast when Stillford came out of the
house with a quick step and an excited air.</p>

<p>"Marchesa," he said, "the Embassy
has arrived! Stabb and Wilbraham are at
the front door, asking an audience of you.
They bring the proposal!"</p>

<p>The Marchesa laid down her book; Miss
Gilletson made no effort to conceal her
agitation.</p>

<p>"Why didn't they come by the path?"
cried Norah.</p>

<p>"They couldn't very well; Lynborough's
sent them in a carriage&mdash;with postilions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and four horses," Stillford answered gravely.
"The postilions appear to be amused, but
the Ambassadors are exceedingly solemn."</p>

<p>The Marchesa's spirits rose. If the piece
were to be a comedy, she could play her part!
The same idea was in Stillford's mind.
"He can't mean to be very unpleasant if he
plays the fool like this," he said, looking
round on the company with a smile.</p>

<p>"Admit the Ambassadors!" cried the
Marchesa gaily.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors were ushered on to the
lawn. They advanced with a gravity befitting
the occasion, and bowed low to the
Marchesa. Roger carried a roll of paper of
impressive dimensions. Stillford placed
chairs for the Ambassadors and, at a sign
from the Marchesa, they seated themselves.</p>

<p>"What is your message?" asked the
Marchesa. Suddenly nervousness and fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
laid hold of her again; her voice shook a
little.</p>

<p>"We don't know," answered Stabb. "Give
me the document, Roger."</p>

<p>Roger Wilbraham handed him the scroll.</p>

<p>"We are charged to deliver this to your
Excellency's adviser, and to beg him to read
it to you in our presence." He rose, delivered
the scroll into Stillford's hands, and returned,
majestic in his bulk, to his seat.</p>

<p>"You neither of you know what's in it?"
the Marchesa asked.</p>

<p>They shook their heads.</p>

<p>The Marchesa took hold of Norah's hand
and said quietly, "Please read it to us, Mr.
Stillford. I should like you all to hear."</p>

<p>"That was also Lord Lynborough's desire,"
said Roger Wilbraham.</p>

<p>Stillford unrolled the paper. It was all in
Lynborough's own hand&mdash;written large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
and with fair flourishes. In mockery of the
institution he hated, he had cast it in a
form which at all events aimed at being
legal; too close scrutiny on that score perhaps
it would not abide successfully.</p>

<p>"Silence while the document is read!"
said Stillford; and he proceeded to read it
in a clear and deliberate voice:</p>

<p>"'Sir Ambrose Athelstan Caverly, Baronet,
Baron Lynborough of Lynborough in
the County of Dorset and of Scarsmoor in
the County of Yorkshire, unto her Excellency
Helena Vittoria Maria Antonia, Marchesa
di San Servolo, and unto All to
whom these Presents Come, Greeting.
Whereas the said Lord Lynborough and his
predecessors in title have been ever entitled
as of right to pass and repass along the path
called Beach Path leading across the lands
of Nab Grange from the road bounding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
same on the west to the seashore on the east
thereof, and to use the said path by themselves,
their agents and servants, at their
pleasure, without let or interference from
any person or persons whatsoever&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>Stillford paused and looked at the Marchesa.
The document did not begin in a
conciliatory manner. It asserted the right
to use Beach Path in the most uncompromising
way.</p>

<p>"Go on," commanded the Marchesa,
a little flushed, still holding Norah's hand.</p>

<p>"'And Whereas the said Lord Lynborough
is desirous that his rights as above
defined shall receive the recognition of the
said Marchesa, which recognition has hitherto
been withheld and refused by the said
Marchesa: And Whereas great and manifold
troubles have arisen from such refusal:
And Whereas the said Lord Lynborough is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
desirous of dwelling in peace and amity with
the said Marchesa&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"There, Helena, you see he is!" cried
Norah triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I really must not be interrupted," Stillford
protested. "'Now Therefore the said
Lord Lynborough, moved thereunto by
divers considerations and in chief by his
said desire to dwell in amity and good-will,
doth engage and undertake that, in consideration
of his receiving a full, gracious, and
amicable recognition of his right from the
said Marchesa, he shall and will, year by
year and once a year, to wit on the Feast of
St. John Baptist, also known as Midsummer
Day&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Why, that's to-morrow!" exclaimed Violet
Dufaure.</p>

<p>Once more Stillford commanded silence.
The Terms of Peace were not to be rudely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
interrupted just as they were reaching the
most interesting point. For up to now
nothing had come except a renewed assertion
of Lynborough's right!</p>

<p>"'That is to say the twenty-fourth day
of June&mdash;repair in his own proper person,
with or without attendants as shall seem
to him good, to Nab Grange or such other
place as may then and on each occasion be
the abode and residence of the said Marchesa,
and shall and will present himself
in the presence of the said Marchesa at noon.
And that he then shall and will do homage
to the said Marchesa for such full, gracious,
and amicable recognition as above mentioned
by falling on his knee and kissing
the hand of the said Marchesa. And if the
said Lord Lynborough shall wilfully or by
neglect omit so to present himself and so
to pay his homage on any such Feast of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
John Baptist, then his said right shall be of
no effect and shall be suspended (And he
hereby engages not to exercise the same)
until he shall have purged his contempt or
neglect by performing his homage on the
next succeeding Feast. Provided Always
that the said Marchesa shall and will,
a sufficient time before the said Feast in each
year, apprise and inform the said Lord
Lynborough of her intended place of residence,
in default whereof the said Lord Lynborough
shall not be bound to pay his homage
and shall suffer no diminution of his
right by reason of the omission thereof.
Provided Further and Finally that whensoever
the said Lord Lynborough shall duly
and on the due date as in these Presents
stipulated present himself at Nab Grange
or elsewhere the residence for the time being
of the said Marchesa, and claim to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
admitted to the presence of the said Marchesa
and to perform his homage as herein prescribed
and ordered, the said Marchesa shall
not and will not, on any pretext or for any
cause whatsoever, deny or refuse to accept
the said homage so duly proffered, but shall
and will in all gracious condescension and
neighborly friendship extend and give her
hand to the said Lord Lynborough, to the
end and purpose that, he rendering and she
accepting his homage in all mutual trust and
honorable confidence, Peace may reign
between Nab Grange and Scarsmoor Castle
so long as they both do stand. In Witness
whereof the said Lord Lynborough has
affixed his name on the Eve of the said
Feast of St. John Baptist.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Lynborough</span>.'"<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>Stillford ended his reading, and handed
the scroll to the Marchesa with a bow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
She took it and looked at Lynborough's
signature. Her cheeks were flushed, and
her lips struggled not to smile. The rest were
silent. She looked at Stillford, who smiled
back at her and drew from his pocket&mdash;a
stylographic pen.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and took it.</p>

<p>She wrote below Lynborough's name:</p>

<p>"In Witness whereof, in a desire for peace
and amity, in all mutual trust and honorable
confidence, the said Marchesa has
affixed her name on this same Eve of the
said Feast of St. John Baptist.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Helena di San Servolo</span>."<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>She handed it back to Stillford. "Let it
dry in the beautiful sunlight," she said.</p>

<p>The Ambassadors rose to their feet. She
rose too and went over to Stabb with
outstretched hands. A broad smile spread
over Stabb's spacious face. "It's just like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Ambrose," he said to her as he took her
hands. "He gets what he wants&mdash;but in the
prettiest way!"</p>

<p>She answered him in a low voice: "A
very knightly way of saving a foolish woman's
pride." She raised her voice. "Bid
Lord Lynborough&mdash;aye, Sir Ambrose
Athelstan Caverly, Baron Lynborough, attend
here at Nab Grange to pay his homage
to-morrow at noon." She looked round on
them all, smiling now openly, the red in her
cheeks all triumphant over her olive hue.
"Say I will give him private audience to
receive his homage and to ask his friendship."
With that the Marchesa departed,
somewhat suddenly, into the house.</p>

<p>Amid much merriment and reciprocal
congratulations the Ambassadors were honorably
escorted back to their coach and
four.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Keep your eye on the Castle to-night,"
Roger Wilbraham whispered to Norah as
he pressed her hand.</p>

<p>They drove off, Stillford leading a gay
"Hurrah!"</p>

<p>At night indeed Scarsmoor Castle was a
sight to see. Every window of its front
blazed with light; rockets and all manner
of amazing bright devices rose to heaven.
All Fillby turned out to see the show; all
Nab Grange was in the garden looking on.</p>

<p>All save Helena herself. She had retreated
to her own room; there she sat and
watched alone. She was in a fever of feeling
and could not rest. She twisted one hand
round the other, she held up before her
eyes the hand which was destined to receive
homage on the morrow. Her eyes were
bright, her cheeks flushed, her red lips
trembled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas, how this man knows his way to
my heart!" she sighed.</p>

<p>The blaze at Scarsmoor Castle died down.
A kindly darkness fell. Under its friendly
cover she kissed her hand to the Castle,
murmuring "To-morrow!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE FEAST OF ST. JOHN BAPTIST</h3>


<p>"As there's a heaven above us," wrote
Lynborough that same night&mdash;having been,
one would fain hope, telepathically conscious
of the hand-kissing by the red lips, of the
softly breathed "To-morrow!" (for if he
were not, what becomes of Love's Magic?)&mdash;"As
there's a heaven above us, I have
succeeded! Her answer is more than a consent&mdash;it's
an appreciation. The rogue knew
how she stood: she is haughtily, daintily
grateful. Does she know how near she drove
me to the abominable thing? Almost had
I&mdash;I, Ambrose Caverly&mdash;issued a writ!
I should never, in all my life, have got over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the feeling of being a bailiff! She has saved
me by the rightness of her taste. 'Knightly'
she called it to old Cromlech. Well, that was
in the blood&mdash;it had been my own fault if
I had lost it, no credit of mine if to some
measure I have it still. But to find the
recognition! I have lit up the country-side
to-night to celebrate that rare discovery.</p>

<p>"Rare&mdash;yes&mdash;yet not doubted. I knew
it of her. I believe that I have broken all
records&mdash;since the Renaissance at least.
Love at first sight! Where's the merit in
that? Given the sight be fine enough (a
thing that I pray may not admit of doubt in
the case of Helena), it is no exploit; it is
rather to suffer the inevitable than to achieve
the great. But unless the sight of a figure a
hundred yards away&mdash;and of a back fifty&mdash;is
to count against me as a practical
inspection, I am so supremely lucky as never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
to have seen her! I have made her for myself&mdash;a
few tags of description, a noting
of the effect on Roger and on Cromlech,
mildly (and very unimaginatively) aided
my work, I admit&mdash;but for the most part
and in all essentials, she, as I love her (for
of course I love her, or no amount of Feast
of St. John Baptist should have moved me
from my path&mdash;take that for literal or for
metaphorical as ye will!)&mdash;is of my own
craftsmanship&mdash;work of my heart and
brain, wrought just as I would have her&mdash;as
I knew, through all delightful wanderings,
that some day she must come to me.</p>

<p>"Think then of my mood for to-morrow!
With what feelings do I ring the bell (unless
perchance it be a knocker)! With what
sensations accost the butler! With what
emotions enter the presence! Because if
by chance I am wrong&mdash;! Upon which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
awful doubt arises the question whether, if
I be wrong, I can go back. I am plaguily
the slave of putting the thing as prettily
as it can be put (Thanks, Cromlech, for
giving me the adverb&mdash;not so bad a touch
for a Man of Tombs!), and, on my soul, I
have put that homage of mine so prettily
that one who was prudent would have addressed
it to none other than a married lady&mdash;<i>vivente
marito</i>, be it understood. But from
my goddess her mortal mate is gone&mdash;and
to explain&mdash;nay, not to explain (which
would indeed tax every grace of style)&mdash;but
to let it appear that the homage
lingers, abides, and is confined within the
letter of the bond&mdash;that would seem scarce
'knightly.' Therefore, being (as all tell me)
more of a fool than most men, and (as I
soberly hope) not less of a gentleman, I
stand thus. I love the Image I have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
out of dim distant sight, prosaic shreds of
catalogued description, a vividly creating
mind, and&mdash;to be candid&mdash;the absolute
necessity of amusing myself in the country.
But the Woman I am to see to-morrow?
Is she the Image? I shall know in the first
moment of our encounter. If she is, all is
well for me&mdash;for her it will be just a question
of her dower of heavenly venturousness.
If she is not&mdash;in my humble judgment,
you, Ambrose Caverly, having put the thing
with so excessive a prettiness, shall for your
art's sake perish&mdash;you must, in short, if
you would end this thing in the manner
(creditable to yourself, Ambrose!) in which
it has hitherto been conducted, willy-nilly,
hot or cold, confirmed in divine dreams or
slapped in the face by disenchanting fact&mdash;within
a brief space of time, propose marriage
to this lady. If there be any other course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the gods send me scent of it this night! But
if she should refuse? Reckon not on that.
For the more she fall short of her Image, the
more will she grasp at an outward showing
of triumph&mdash;and the greatest outward
triumph would not be in refusal.</p>

<p>"In my human weakness I wish that&mdash;just
for once&mdash;I had seen her! But in the
strong spirit of the wine of life&mdash;whereof
I have been and am an inveterate and most
incurable bibber&mdash;I rejoice in that wonderful
moment of mine to-morrow&mdash;when the
door of the shrine opens, and I see the goddess
before whom my offering must be laid.
Be she giant or dwarf, be she black or white,
have she hair or none&mdash;by the powers,
if she wears a sack only, and is well advised
to stick close to that, lest casting it should
be a change for the worse&mdash;in any event
the offering must be made. Even so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Prince in the tales, making his vows to the
Beast and not yet knowing if his spell shall
transform it to the Beauty! In my stronger
moments, so would I have it. Years of life
shall I live in that moment to-morrow!
If it end ill, no human being but myself
shall know. If it end well, the world is not
great enough to hold, nor the music of its
spheres melodious enough to sound, my
triumph!"</p>

<p>It will be observed that Lord Lynborough,
though indeed no novice in the cruel and
tender passion, was appreciably excited
on the Eve of the Feast of St. John Baptist.
In view of so handsome a response, the
Marchesa's kiss of the hand and her murmured
"To-morrow" may pass excused of
forwardness.</p>

<p>It was, nevertheless, a gentleman to all
seeming most cool and calm who presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
himself at the doors of Nab Grange at
eleven fifty-five the next morning. His Ambassadors
had come in magnificence; humbly
he walked&mdash;and not by Beach Path,
since his homage was not yet paid&mdash;but
round by the far-stretching road and up
the main avenue most decorously. Stabb
and Roger had cut across by the path&mdash;holding
the Marchesa's leave and license
so to do&mdash;and had joined an excited group
which sat on chairs under sheltering trees.</p>

<p>"I wish she hadn't made the audience
private!" said Norah Mountliffey.</p>

<p>"If ever a keyhole were justifiable&mdash;"
sighed Violet Dufaure.</p>

<p>"My dear, I'd box your ears myself,"
Miss Gilletson brusquely interrupted.</p>

<p>The Marchesa sat in a high arm-chair,
upholstered in tarnished fading gold. The
sun from the window shone on her hair;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
her face was half in shadow. She rested
her head on her left; hand the right lay on
her knee. It was stripped of any ring&mdash;unadorned
white. Her cheeks were pale&mdash;the
olive reigned unchallenged; her lips
were set tight, her eyes downcast. She made
no movement when Lord Lynborough entered.</p>

<p>He bowed low, but said nothing. He
stood opposite to her some two yards away.
The clock ticked. It wanted still a minute
before noon struck. That was the minute
of which Lynborough had raved and dreamed
the night before. He had the fruit of it in
full measure.</p>

<p>The first stroke of twelve rang silvery
from the clock. Lynborough advanced and
fell upon his knee. She did not lift her eyes,
but slowly raised her hand from her knee.
He placed his hand under it, pressing it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
little upward and bowing his head to meet
it half-way in its ascent. She felt his lips
lightly brush the skin. His homage for
Beach Path and his right therein was duly
paid.</p>

<p>Slowly he rose to his feet; slowly her eyes
turned upward to his face. It was ablaze
with a great triumph; the fire seemed to
spread to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It's better than I dreamed or hoped,"
he murmured.</p>

<p>"What? To have peace between us?
Yes, it's good."</p>

<p>"I have never seen your face before."
She made no answer. "Nor you mine?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Once on Sandy Nab you passed by me.
You didn't notice me&mdash;but, yes, I saw you."
Her eyes were steadily on him now; the
flush had ceased to deepen, nay, had re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>ceded,
but abode still, tingeing the olive
of her cheeks.</p>

<p>"I have rendered my homage," he said.</p>

<p>"It is accepted." Suddenly tears sprang
to her eyes. "And you might have been so
cruel to me!" she whispered.</p>

<p>"To you? To you who carry the power
of a world in your face?"</p>

<p>The Marchesa was confused&mdash;as was,
perhaps, hardly unnatural.</p>

<p>"There are other things, besides gates
and walls, and Norah's head, that you jump
over, Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"I lived a life while I stood waiting for the
clock to strike. I have tried for life before&mdash;in
that minute I found it." He seemed
suddenly to awake as though from a dream.
"But I beg your pardon. I have paid my
dues. The bond gives me no right to linger."</p>

<p>She rose with a light laugh&mdash;yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
sounded nervous. "Is it good-by till next St.
John Baptist's day?"</p>

<p>"You would see me walking on Beach
Path day by day."</p>

<p>"I never call it Beach Path."</p>

<p>"May it now be called&mdash;Helena's?"</p>

<p>"Or will you stay and lunch with me to-day?
And you might even pay homage
again&mdash;say to-morrow&mdash;or&mdash;or some day
in the week."</p>

<p>"Lunch, most certainly. That commits
me to nothing. Homage, Marchesa, is quite
another matter."</p>

<p>"Your chivalry is turning to bargaining,
Lord Lynborough."</p>

<p>"It was never anything else," he answered.</p>

<p>"Homage is rendered in payment&mdash;that's
why one says 'Whereas.'" His keen eager
eyes of hazel raised once more the flood of
subdued crimson in her face. "For every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
recognition of a right of mine, I will pay you
homage according to the form prescribed for
St. John Baptist's Feast."</p>

<p>"Of what other rights do you ask recognition?"</p>

<p>"There might be the right of welcoming
you at Scarsmoor to-morrow?"</p>

<p>She made him a little curtsy. "It is accorded&mdash;on
the prescribed terms, my lord."</p>

<p>"That will do for the twenty-fifth. There
might be the right of escorting you home from
Scarsmoor by the path called&mdash;Helena's?"</p>

<p>"On the prescribed terms it is your lordship's."</p>

<p>"What then of the right to see you daily,
and day by day?"</p>

<p>"If your leisure serves, my lord, I will
endeavor to adjust mine&mdash;so long as we
both remain at Fillby. But so that the homage
is paid!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"But if you go away?"</p>

<p>"I'm bound to tell you of my whereabouts
only on St. John Baptist's Feast."</p>

<p>"The right to know it on other days&mdash;would
that be recognized in return for a
homage, Marchesa?"</p>

<p>"One homage for so many letters?"</p>

<p>"I had sooner there were no letters&mdash;and
daily homages."</p>

<p>"You take too many obligations&mdash;and
too lightly."</p>

<p>"For every one I gain the recognition of a
right."</p>

<p>"The richer you grow in rights then, the
harder you must work!"</p>

<p>"I would have so many rights accorded
me as to be no better than a slave!" cried
Lynborough. "Yet, if I have not one, still
I have nothing."</p>

<p>She spoke no word, but looked at him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
long and searchingly. She was not nervous
now, but proud. Her look bade him weigh
words; they had passed beyond the borders
of merriment, beyond the bandying of
challenges. Yet her eyes carried no prohibition;
it was a warning only. She interposed
no conventional check, no plea for
time. She laid on him the responsibility
for his speech; let him remember that he
owed her homage.</p>

<p>They grew curious and restless on the
lawn; the private audience lasted long, the
homage took much time in paying.</p>

<p>"A marvelous thing has come to me,"
said Lynborough, speaking slower than his
wont, "and with it a great courage. I have
seen my dream. This morning I came here
not knowing whether I should see it. I
don't speak of the face of my dream-image
only, though I could speak till next St. John's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
Day upon that. I speak to a soul. I think our
souls have known one another longer, aye,
and better than our faces."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it is so," she said quietly.
"Yet who can tell so soon?"</p>

<p>"There's a great gladness upon me because
my dream came true."</p>

<p>"Who can tell so soon?" she asked again.
"It's strange to speak of it."</p>

<p>"It may be that some day&mdash;yes, some
day soon&mdash;in return for the homage of my
lips on your hand, I would ask the recognition
of my lip's right on your cheek."</p>

<p>She came up to him and laid her hand on
his arm. "Suffer me a little while, my lord,"
she said. "You've swept into my life like a
whirlwind; you would carry me by assault
as though I were a rebellious city. Am I
to be won before ever I am wooed?"</p>

<p>"You sha'n't lack wooing," he said quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>ly.
"Yet haven't I wooed you already&mdash;as
well in my quarrel as in my homage, in our
strife as in the end of it?"</p>

<p>"I think so, yes. Yet suffer me a little
still."</p>

<p>"If you doubt&mdash;" he cried.</p>

<p>"I don't think I doubt. I linger." She
gave her hand into his. "It's strange, but
I cannot doubt."</p>

<p>Lynborough sank again upon his knee and
paid his homage. As he rose, she bent ever
so slightly toward him; delicately he kissed
her cheek.</p>

<p>"I pray you," she whispered, "use gently
what you took with that."</p>

<p>"Here's a heart to my heart, and a spirit
to my spirit&mdash;and a glad venture to us
both!"</p>

<p>"Come on to the lawn now, but tell them
nothing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Save that I have paid my homage, and
received the recognition of my right?"</p>

<p>"That, if you will&mdash;and that your path
is to be&mdash;henceforward&mdash;Helena's."</p>

<p>"I hope to have no need to travel far on
the Feast of St. John!" cried Lynborough.</p>

<p>They went out on the lawn. Nothing was
asked, and nothing told, that day. In truth
there appeared to be no need. For it seems
as though Love were not always invisible,
nor the twang of his bow so faint as to elude
the ear. With joyous blood his glad wounds
are red, and who will may tell the sufferers.
Sympathy too lends insight; your fellow-sufferer
knows your plight first. There were
fellow-sufferers on the lawn that day&mdash;to
whom, as to all good lovers, here's Godspeed.</p>

<p>She went with him in the afternoon
through the gardens, over the sunk fence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
across the meadows, till they came to the
path. On it they walked together.</p>

<p>"So is your right recognized, my lord,"
she said.</p>

<p>"We will walk together on Helena's
Path," he answered, "until it leads us&mdash;still
together&mdash;to the Boundless Sea."</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
